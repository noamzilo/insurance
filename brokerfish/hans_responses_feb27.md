**Re: Germany home country question**

> Expacare: I would say it is separate and nothing you have to worry about as long as you do not move back to one country and spend more than 6 months there.
> OG: is germany treated differently than israel? I would say it is separate and nothing you have to worry about as long as you do not move back to one country and spend more than 6 months there.

Both Expacare and OG: Hans says the 6-month rule is **per country, not cumulative**. As long as you don't spend more than 6 months in any single country (Israel or Germany), you're fine. This is his interpretation, not confirmed from Expacare contract language.

**Re: OG §7a — "vary benefits, cover and/or premium"**

> This is related to everyone on cover, not you as an individual. Previously they had a lower level plan with USD 200k coverage and no outpatient, they increased to USD 1MM and USD 500 so all on the original plan were changed to this new policy.

Hans's position: OG §7a changes are pool-wide, not individual. Historical example given: OG upgraded an old low-coverage plan to USD 1M/USD 500 outpatient for all policyholders on that plan.

**Re: OG §8 — either party can terminate**

> Any provider can go out of business or withdraw a whole line of products if no underwriter/insurer is willing to accept the risk/book of business.

Hans's framing: §8 is a standard business exit clause, not a mechanism for singling out individuals.

**Re: Expacare "individual cases" clause vs "will not cancel for age/health"**

> To the very best of my knowledge, I cannot see that they would single out one individual on claims. However, I have asked for clarification on this.

Hans flagged the contradiction and escalated to Expacare for a formal answer.

**New provider introduced: Expatriate Group Primary+**

- **Underwriting**: Moratorium — no health questions on application. Chronic conditions and anything within the 2 years preceding start date are excluded at inception. Can be covered later once claim-free.
- **NCB**: Up to 20% no-claim bonus after 3 claim-free years.
- **Premium history**: Not adjusted more than once in 7–8 years (only age bracket changes). Managed via NCB reducing submitted claims.
- **Claims process**: "They do ask more questions related to claims once submitted so it is not for everyone."
- **Quote**: Primary+, Worldwide excl. USA, $500 excess per condition per policy year = **USD 2,032/year (~$169/month)**
- **Key limits**:
  - Outpatient management of chronic conditions: **$20,000/year** (no excess applies to this benefit)
  - Organ transplant: **$150,000**
  - Health check: $250 after 12 months
- Hans's note: "This limit could in some cases be on the low side along with the organ transplant limit."
- **Hans's recommendation**: "Among the 3 and provided within your budget Expacare is probably my choice today considering our discussions. It is much more benefit rich and the deductible is annual. You could even remove the deductible and it is almost within budget."

## Email 2: Expacare Formal Clarification on Individual Premium Singling

Fast response from a "very senior lady within Expacare." Full text:

> The amendment clause reflects standard international medical insurance wording and is consistent with provisions used by major insurers. In practice, it is rarely exercised on policies mid-term and is not used as a discretionary repricing mechanism. Any changes would only occur in clearly defined circumstances (e.g. regulatory requirements or material underwriting factors) and would always be communicated in advance in line with policy and regulatory notice requirements. The intention is to ensure compliance flexibility, not to introduce uncertainty for members.

**Key points from this statement:**
- Clause is "standard wording" used across the industry
- "Rarely exercised on policies mid-term" — note: mid-term, not at renewal
- "Not used as a discretionary repricing mechanism"
- Changes limited to "regulatory requirements or material underwriting factors"
- "Compliance flexibility, not uncertainty for members"

**What this is and isn't:**
- This is an informal written assurance from a senior Expacare employee via the broker, not a contractual amendment
- It does not modify the contract
- "Material underwriting factors" is undefined and potentially broad
- "Mid-term" qualifier leaves ambiguity about renewal-time individual adjustments
- It is, however, the most direct response available on this question short of a contract change
