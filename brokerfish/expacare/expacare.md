Hans:
Hi Noam,

Optimum Global was initially incorporated in 2005. For the first years I think Aetna was he insurer, later and if I am not mistaken, Lloyds where involved until 2017 when Optimum Global launched their own insurance company in Gurnsey. Hence their journey/existence is longer than 2017. For full disclosure we started doing business with them around 2019, that was when Steve Conway joined as MD. I know Steve since around 2012 and primarily worked with him during his time with Allianz Care in Shanghai. He stayed with Alilanz in various positions until he joined Optimum Global.

 

We have a wide panel of providers but work closer with some of them. Allianz Care is obviously great as is Cigna but their premiums are always on the high side. I have attached a Cigna quote overview and as you can see premiums are really on the high side. Allianz are similar and due to outpatient limitations on lower plans you would need to go for the top one and then premiums are well above USD 5,000 depending on the options you make (deductible) but even with a USD 1,350 core plan deductible the annual premium is USD 5,356.

 

Considering your concerns re Optimum Global I would like to introduce ExpaCare. I know them very well and we have been working with them for over 10 years, they have been around for 40 years and are insured at Lloyds of London, probably the worlds most recognized insurance marketplace. I should have included them in my first email to you… apologies for not doing so!

 

Their premiums and the benefits offered on their highest plan with options: Area worldwide excl. USA/Caribbean, USD 850 deductible, Core plan, Full cancer/chronic, Advanced outpatient, Dental, wellness & Optical comes at USD 3,809. With a nil Excess annual premium is USD 4,481. This premium is with a full lifestyle discount (if you have a normal BMI, no or few sick days last year, do not drink excessively, do not smoke and exercise a bit every week). Their assistance company is the same as the British foreign services use for all their overseas staff, Healix. They can help to produce reports such as the one attached for various locations.

 

I have attached info on Expacare including an application form. In addition, Healix wrote as follows re Kunming:

 

What is the quality like of the medical facilities and hospitals in Kunming?
As a background, hospitals in China are categorised into 3 levels based on the level of service provision, size, medical technology, medical equipment, management and medical quality. Hospitals are further subdivided into 3 subsidiary levels: A, B and C. Therefore, most hospitals are levelled in a total of 9 levels. Please note that there is also a grade 3AAA which are the most specialised hospitals, but they are not located in every city.

In Kunming there are a few Grade 3A hospitals and the rest of the major hospitals are Grade 2 or higher. Therefore, we don’t have any concerns about the quality of medical services as long as the patient visits Grade 2 or 3 hospitals. (preferable Grade 3 hospital).

 

Any there private hospitals/English speaking available?
All 3 hospitals in the provider listing have an international department. Therefore, the patient should be able to seek assistance in English – although we cannot guarantee who will actually be able to speak English. The Yunnan Richland International Hospital is a lower-grade hospital than others, but it is designed for international patients, and we can arrange GOP through a local agent.

 

Have Healix faced any difficulties in setting up and placing GOP’s in the area and if so, what would the issues be?
All providers in the report are public hospitals, which complicates the GOP process and, as such, 2 of the providers are on a pay and claim basis. It may be possible for us to appoint a local agent to, literally, carry a bag of cash to the hospital and make payment. As stated above we can GOP via an agent at the Yunnan Richland International Hospital.

 

Would local agents be used?
As stated above, we can appoint the agent for the following services.

GOP placement to the certain hospitals
Arrange a Runner to settle the payments.
