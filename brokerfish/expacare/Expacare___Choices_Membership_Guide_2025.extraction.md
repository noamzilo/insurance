## 2. Administration of Your Plan

This guide, in conjunction with **your** application form, **your** **insurance certificate**, Membership Guide Supplement and any Addendum attached makes up the contract between **you**/**your Sponsoring Organisation** and **us**, with the purpose of providing **you** with **benefit** when **you** need medical **treatment**.

<a id='f2dafc24-f2a6-418a-a89e-e63e39176a91'></a>

Where this is a **Group Policy** or **Corporate Advantage Plan Policy** it has been arranged through **your sponsoring organisation** who is approved by **us**. **Your sponsoring organisation** has agreed the rules of **your** membership and details of the insurance cover.

This plan is a one-year contract renewable each year on the anniversary of the **start/enrolment date** by **you** if an **Individual Policy** and by **your sponsoring organisation** if a **Group Policy** or **Corporate Advantage Plan Policy** (the premium rates in force at the time **you** or **your sponsoring organisation** renew, and any changes **we** have given **you** or **your sponsoring organisation** written notice of, will apply). **We** will renew the plan when **we** receive the premium.

<a id='7fe23fe7-0592-4414-a711-b5610ec18467'></a>

Changes in cover can only be made at renewal and must be advised to **us** in writing prior to the **renewal date**. Any changes requested will be subject to **Insurers'** acceptance.

<a id='60633c54-6c05-4b0b-bcf7-61c38d0f555b'></a>

A change in currency at renewal will require **you** to apply for a new policy.

<a id='2fad4ad5-affb-4d9e-ad92-496679c7ccff'></a>

Insurers reserve the right to amend or alter premiums and terms
on individual cases.

<a id='de1a8804-e831-4448-864b-6818edb74979'></a>

## 2.4 Ending your cover
We may end **your** cover during the term of **your** plan for **you**
(as the **insured person**) and **your dependants** in the following
situations:

<a id='ceb9ff5e-2ca3-4d73-9724-7f92c18a9e17'></a>

**If you, your dependants or your agent:**
* withhold relevant information or give **us** incorrect information
* make any false or fraudulent **claim**
* fail to provide any reasonable information **we** have asked for
* fail to pay the premiums due
* give threatening or abusive behaviour

<a id='851a3d26-6aab-4049-a91d-d755adaa47cd'></a>

If **you** or your **dependants**:
> move to the USA
> move back to **your home country** on a permanent basis.

<a id='e2609a52-9899-4ba9-bc6d-8fe36f2d8b1f'></a>

In respect of a **Group Policy** or **Corporate Advantage Plan Policy** cover will end if:
*   **Your sponsoring organisation** confirms **you** are no longer eligible for **group** membership
*   **You** cease to be an employee of the **sponsoring organisation**

<a id='a2de0d08-6bd8-4031-b841-7747bca7fe94'></a>

We may decide to discontinue the plan or any part of it. **We** have
the right to alter the terms of membership and the contract at
any time. In respect of a **Group Policy** or **Corporate Advantage**
**Plan Policy**, your **sponsoring organisation** is responsible for
telling **you** immediately if **your** cover has been cancelled.

<a id='6554a6c4-9e7d-44cc-9962-78c3d8141329'></a>

**We** will not cancel **your** plan because of **your** age or health record.

<a id='d513ba38-f523-4a95-9cf8-42a658e5be29'></a>

If a policy is cancelled and a **claim** has been made then the full annual premium will be due. Any costs incurred in recovering due premiums will be the responsibility of the **policyholder**.

<a id='45d47dab-6e07-4c74-bfe0-84d605de0c7e'></a>

Any **claims** received after a refund will be declined.

<a id='376f2e9e-3a02-4601-ae70-6dcef32f207c'></a>

2.5 Your cancellation rights
You should make any request for cancellation of a policy to us in
writing. You have a right to cancel your policy if it does not meet

<a id='02a8e9df-a73e-4e93-8bb5-767f53fd5a52'></a>

**your** requirements or for any other reason within 14 days of the date **you** receive **your** policy documents or the inception date, whichever is the latest. If no **claims** have been made **you** will receive a full refund.

<a id='c47174db-45d9-4abf-8d56-c8878daf3931'></a>

**You** may cancel after the 14 days have expired. **You** may be entitled to a pro-rated refund if **you** have made no **claims**. No return of premium will be given in the event that any **claim** has been reported to the **Insurer**.

<a id='b4be6f7f-e4c0-4c2e-87a0-e1e129d849e7'></a>

## 3. Plan Conditions

These conditions form an important part of **your** plan and it is important **you** read them carefully.

<a id='f3b0e2bb-2283-4375-a33d-174edf3b1ebd'></a>

Any **benefit** referenced in these conditions is only available if it is shown on **your insurance certificate**.

<a id='733ab825-203a-4248-94a4-028a35cfafc4'></a>

3.1 Dependants
**Your dependants** must be named on the **insurance certificate** to qualify for **benefit**. If **you** would like **your** child to be added to **your** plan, **you** must give **us** the details. **We** do not add newborn babies unless **you** ask **us** to.

<a id='db4233d7-294e-4f6a-aff5-f116ab9b5fd2'></a>

Maternity Level 1 or Maternity Level 2 module - **We** can add **your** child to **your** policy from the date of birth if **we** have covered the birth under the Maternity Level 1 or Maternity Level 2 module, and **you** give **us** the details within 30 days of the date of birth. If **your** child is not added from their date of birth, they will be underwritten.

<a id='752633bb-7983-47c5-ba94-2e2855ab1ce2'></a>

If the birth was not covered under the Maternity Level 1 or Maternity Level 2 module, benefit for **your** child will only start from the day the child is discharged from **hospital**.

<a id='3bc99848-fe32-482b-8fe3-8a108d2600ab'></a>

3.2 Doctors' recognised qualifications

We have the right to withhold **benefit** for **treatment** by **doctors** who do not hold internationally recognised qualifications or training. For example, a school listed in the World Health Organisation's World Directory of Medical Schools.

<a id='b23c8d2f-cd0a-4356-84d6-954d741bc54f'></a>

## 3.3 Information that you provide to us – for consumer contracts
If **you** are an individual covered by this plan or an individual buying insurance outside **your** trade, business or profession, **you** must take reasonable care to answer all the questions asked by the **Insurer** and **us** in connection with **your** insurance, whether through a a proposal form or otherwise, honestly and to the best of **your** knowledge, and provide complete and accurate answers. If **you** make a misrepresentation to the **Insurer** (whether innocently or otherwise), the **Insurer** may impose additional policy terms, or reduce a **claim** payment, or even to cancel the policy and refuse all **claims**. If **you** make a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation, the **Insurer** may cancel the policy and refuse all **claims**, and in these circumstances the **Insurer** will be entitled to retain any premium paid by **you**. **You** should note that failure to comply with a request at renewal to confirm or amend particulars **you** have previously given may amount to misrepresentation which could prejudice **your** insurance cover in whole or in part.

Where guidance is provided in relation to a question please ensure
that **you** read this fully to ensure the correct answer is provided.
If **you** are in any way uncertain about any of the questions asked,
please seek further clarification from **your** broker or from **us**.

<a id='1320e4d3-64c3-4e69-a6fc-05b64f674f5a'></a>

If **you** become aware that information **you** have given **us** is inaccurate, **you** must inform **us** or **your** broker as soon as practicable.

<a id='8df291fc-1998-4aec-975b-3911503a5bf8'></a>

**3.4 Duty of Fair Presentation – for business contracts**
If **you** are an individual purchasing or renewing insurance in connection with **your** business, trade or profession, or **you** are a **sponsoring organisation** purchasing or renewing a **Group Policy** or a **Corporate Advantage Plan Policy**, **you** must be aware of the duty of fair presentation. This obliges **you** to provide accurate answers to all questions. Failure to comply with this obligation may entitle the **Insurer** to decline **your claim**, pay a proportionate amount of **your claim** only, or cancel **your policy**.

<a id='c78e2ad9-f789-48fa-9987-d89c872382c2'></a>

The duty of fair presentation, in relation to questions asked by the
**Insurer**, is a duty to provide to the **Insurer**:

- details of material circumstances which the **insured person**
knows or ought to know, or
- failing that, answers which give the **Insurer** sufficient
information to put a prudent **Insurer** on notice that it needs
to make further enquiries for the purposes of revealing
those material circumstances.

<a id='50f6d90c-e4eb-4b2a-9fbf-4a12d3d4b51f'></a>

A material circumstance is one which would influence the judgment of a prudent **Insurer** (not necessarily the **Insurer** in question) in determining whether to take the risk and, if so, on what terms. Examples of such circumstances could be any ongoing serious medical conditions, or planned or pending medical **treatment**. Please note that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are by no means exhaustive or conclusive.

<a id='dcb1fb32-6d50-4d78-960b-dfd919b0668f'></a>

It is important to understand who in **your** business has "knowledge" for the purposes of this duty:

> If **you** are an individual buying cover in connection with **your** business, **you** will be presumed to know what **you** actually know and what is known by the individuals responsible for **your** insurance (such as **your** broker);

> If **you** are a corporate entity, **you** will be presumed to know what is known by the business's "senior management" and the individuals responsible for its insurance (such as **your** risk management team and **your** broker). Senior Management means those individuals who, in connection with the risks to be insured, play significant roles in the making of decisions about how the **insured person's** activities are to be managed.

<a id='b90f8bae-8785-4bc2-aeca-63ec79b723de'></a>

We will seek to agree with the **Insurer** in advance of any placement whose “knowledge” counts for the purposes of the duty, and will in any event provide **you** with guidance on this.

<a id='2b9ff699-d889-4a46-9967-812dc2d96f28'></a>

Please note that **you** will be treated as knowing:
*   material circumstances of which **you** (or the relevant persons identified above) have actual knowledge;
*   material circumstances which **you** suspect but **you** have deliberately refrained from confirming or enquiring about; and
*   material circumstances about which **you** ought to know (i.e. circumstances which should reasonably have been revealed

<a id='ca9fd352-5828-4bc9-b89a-25580ddad4bf'></a>

by a reasonable search of information available to you).
This means that in some circumstances the responsible individuals
will be required to make enquiries, and the information (and
therefore the scope of those enquiries) may not necessarily be
limited to that held by the business. We will provide advice and
guidance on the nature and extent of searches that may be
required to comply with the duty.

<a id='69f8f78b-4cc1-4ef2-b54e-a7d3e3e5ea21'></a>

The duty of fair presentation continues up until the insurance has been concluded and 'resurrects' in the event of any amendment to the risk during the policy period or extension/renewal. It may also be that the terms of the policy include specific ongoing disclosure conditions or conditions which effectively extend certain disclosure obligations post inception of the policy.
In completing a proposal or claim form or any other material document relating to an insurance policy and in providing information to or for the **Insurer**, the accuracy and completeness of all answers, statements and/or information is the **policyholder's** own responsibility and it is of paramount importance that all relevant information is provided and that it is accurate. Should **you** so require, **you** may request that **we** assist **you** by providing examples of the sorts of matters which ought to be disclosed as being material or arguably material circumstances, in general terms, or specific to **your** risk from the knowledge **we** gain from working with **you** to understand **your** risk.

<a id='5679bcaa-a55a-4d8a-9f47-a1a5c9347aa0'></a>

In the event that there is a breach of the duty of fair presentation,
Insurers are generally limited to "proportionate remedies",
linked to what they would have done if the risk had been fairly
presented. This may result in the imposition of different terms, or
the proportionate reduction of claims where a higher premium
would have been charged. In circumstances where Insurers would
not have entered into the contract on any terms they can avoid
the contract and refuse all claims, but must return the premium.
If the breach is deliberate or reckless Insurers can avoid the policy,
refuse all claims and keep the premium.

<a id='d8ed7877-f9e9-4886-8ec1-767a8ce2f1f8'></a>

If **you** are in any doubt as to the scope of the duty of fair presentation or whether a piece of information ought to be disclosed, please do not hesitate to contact **your** broker or **us**.

<a id='ce4eaeb1-4431-4565-bfd5-b27307ab1582'></a>

## 3.5 Local taxes
The **policyholder** is liable for any local taxes due on the insurance premium unless these taxes have been shown on **your** invoice and paid. In these cases **Insurers** will account to the local tax authorities for the tax due.

<a id='a1a3de0e-7b23-4f3a-94c8-e9aa8125150d'></a>

## 3.6 Medical advice
**You** are responsible for complying with any medical advice/
**treatment** given to **you** by **your doctor** or other treating
healthcare professional.

<a id='80a842fb-3658-4ca3-a4b0-fbc7796edf2a'></a>

3.7 Payments
Expacare Limited is able to offer the choice of paying premiums on
either an annual, a semi-annual or quarterly basis (frequency to be
confirmed prior to renewal of the policy). An administration charge
of 2% for semi-annual payments and 4% for quarterly payments
will be applied. These administration charges are not applicable
when **Individual Policies** are issued to **policyholders** in the EEA.

<a id='96c86a06-d262-43c3-9f0c-734f4b097454'></a>

In respect of **Individual policies**, if **you** do not live in the EEA and
are paying for **your** insurance via instalments then **you** will not

## 4. Benefits: what we can cover

As with any insurance contract, there are conditions attached to claiming **benefit**, so please look carefully at the **benefits** table, notes and plan conditions (section 3), along with the definitions (section 5) and exclusions (section 6). Together with **your insurance certificate**, they define the **benefits** available to **you** and **your dependants** under this plan.

We will only pay for eligible **treatment** received within the period

Please also refer to the "Your Guide to Making a Claim" document on **our** website. Please send **us** **your** complete **claim** as quickly as **you** can, but no later than 6 months after **you** started **your** **treatment**. If any required information is submitted later than 6 months following the start of **treatment**, **we** will not pay the **claim**.

<a id='e4cf188e-c87d-4c94-963b-3fb6677f57d1'></a>

You must send **us** a filled in claim form with the relevant bills and receipts (please do not send photocopies or duplicate bills).

<a id='19e7449a-d946-4dd7-a875-cfc8fe4d3c1a'></a>

Processes for making **claims**, **pre-authorisation** and **guarantees of payment** are different if **you** have purchased a DHA plan. Please refer to 'Your Guide to Making a Claim' document sent with **your** Membership Guide for further details.

## 7.2 What information you need to supply to us
Refer to the 'Your Guide to Making a Claim' document which can be found on **our** website for full details.

<a id='350bef35-3a2b-4071-bcc6-8a2603037d2a'></a>

It is important for **you** to know that **we** are only able to reimburse medical expenses when **we** have received:
- a completed claim form.
- invoices (including a full breakdown of the costs of treatment received).
- any additional information deemed necessary by **our** medical advisors to complete **our** assessment. This may include clinical photographs.
- If **claims** have been paid by **you**, **we** will also require proof of payment.

<a id='913a95a9-d3e9-492b-ad49-366ab8d45491'></a>

**We** must receive the above information within 6 months of the
**treatment** date.
These invoices and documents become **our** property and **we**
reserve the right to store them in any durable medium.

<a id='a3389716-2932-490c-8bfc-b697bf35c30a'></a>

It is important to note that **you** should retain all original copies
of forms and invoices as **we** reserve the right to request these
documents for audit purposes and request that **you** keep these
for a minimum of 6 months after the treatment date.

<a id='4ac2ce97-2edd-44b5-bb56-c6e02fd61fcb'></a>

**Your** documents and invoices should be sent to the address shown
on **your** claim form. **We** strongly recommend that **you** keep copies
of these documents in case the originals are lost in transit.

<a id='bd4e35c8-9583-487d-9df8-e9fa022d5358'></a>

We reserve the right to request that **you** attend a **specialist**/ doctor of **our** choice for a second opinion.
If **your** course of **treatment** exceeds 6 months, please ensure **you** obtain and submit an interim invoice.

<a id='773eceac-6559-4183-9505-8caabbdae5e8'></a>

If **you** are claiming for more than one medical condition, a separate claim form must be completed annually for each condition.

<a id='08b6a574-c84f-4628-b88d-55de36233604'></a>

Wherever possible please use the claim form which **we** have
provided in order to apply for reimbursement of expenses.
This form must be signed by the person providing the service
or **treatment** - Section B (e.g. **doctor**) and by the claimant -
Section A (or the parent or guardian if the claimant is a child).

<a id='66a6c8d6-efd4-4a14-909f-5be0ba9d110e'></a>

The claim form is available to download from **our** website www.expacare.com.

<a id='82496bbb-e14a-4ab8-b1c3-a66500b2d9ab'></a>

If **you** are claiming **hospital cash benefit** a certificate confirming the **in-patient treatment**, the diagnosis, the date of admission and discharge will be required.

<a id='392f04de-ed6c-4bed-84ec-b9bade792ea6'></a>

**7.3 Claims Payments**
**We** will normally reimburse invoices in the invoice currency.

<a id='a09e31cc-8c77-43c6-825b-1a1cb54d6f9b'></a>

However **we** can reimburse invoices in currencies other than the
invoice currency. The preferred currency for payment should be
specified on the claim form.

<a id='70c2465d-1524-4f14-853d-d5f78c9abcf6'></a>

Normally reimbursement will be made to **you**. However, **we** can make reimbursement directly to the party issuing the invoice. This may be useful in emergencies or if particularly high sums are involved. If payment is to be made to a party other than **yourself**

this should be indicated on the claim form (Section A).

**We** are unable to re-issue a cheque that was originally issued more than 2 years ago.

<a id='afdafaf2-4d01-43c0-8877-7ee1d8f96211'></a>

We will not be responsible for any bank charges (other than those
charged by **our** own bank) or foreign exchange currency variances
which may be applied during the claims process.

<a id='2a484b12-8f1c-423e-9afb-7cd91ae94491'></a>

Any **claims** paid incorrectly must be reimbursed to Expacare by
the **Sponsoring Organisation** in the case of a **Group Policy** or
**Corporate Advantage Plan Policy** and insured member in the
case of an **Individual Policy**.

<a id='47fc2ced-216f-4596-87ab-8547f58c89bf'></a>

We will only pay for eligible **treatment** received within the period of cover and the **geographic area** of cover shown on your **insurance certificate**. The purpose of this plan is to provide you with **benefit** when you need medical **treatment**. **Benefits** are limited to the usual **reasonable** and **customary** charges (as determined by **us**) in the area where **treatment** is provided.

<a id='8d472ad8-5abd-4dff-aad8-6c70c8e041fc'></a>

## 7.4 If you or your sponsoring organisation have chosen an excess on your plan

To reduce premiums **your** policy may require **you** to pay an **excess**. For an **Individual Policy** the type and level of **excess** will be selected by **You** at the time of taking out or renewing **your** plan. In the case of a **Group Policy** or **Corporate Advantage Plan Policy** your **sponsoring organisation** will select the type and level of **excess** at the time it takes out or renews the plan. An **excess** is the amount **you** pay towards the costs of a **claim** for any **insured person** on **your** plan. Some **benefits** carry an additional automatic **excess** or **co-payment**. Any **excess** is charged in the same currency as **your** premium.

<a id='f79bd267-2ee0-44a0-b2d5-dc4af2d0fddf'></a>

The **excess you** have selected will be clearly shown on **your** insurance certificate.

<a id='2e5ccd78-6669-4bb8-877c-701fe637764c'></a>

Over and above the optional plan **excesses** there are also additional **excesses** and **co-payments** on certain **benefits**, in particular dental (**co-payment**). When a **claim** is made for these **benefits**, these **benefit excesses** / **co-payments** are deducted in addition to any plan **excess** that may apply.

<a id='2ce02d8f-0e0f-45ae-9de4-85957740ded6'></a>

Please remember that any **benefit excess** applies for each
certificate period. This means that if **you** are claiming over
your renewal date, the **excess** will apply twice.

<a id='d46f6e0c-29fa-4252-b8d1-29d95e2e628a'></a>

You need to submit **your** claim form and bills, even if the
**excess** is greater than the fees **you** are claiming for, so **we**
can apply **your excess** correctly. When **you** make a **claim**, **we**
will reduce the amount **we** pay **you** until the **excess** is used
up. **Excesses** are only taken from eligible **claims** and so count
towards any **benefit** limits.

<a id='885a06ff-36b1-4b4c-8129-2851278897e4'></a>

## 7.5 Fraudulent Claims
If the **insured person** makes a fraudulent **claim** under this insurance contract, the **Insurer**:
* Is not liable to pay the **claim**; and
* May recover from the **insured person** any sums paid by the **Insurer** to the **insured person** in respect of the **claim**; and

<a id='b637a2ec-278d-4fa1-ab76-c1524fbd1bd3'></a>

> May by notice to the **insured person** treat the contract
as having been terminated with effect from the time of
the fraudulent act.

<a id='5c0981de-40e0-4941-aaf7-047fb158605b'></a>

If the **Insurer** exercises its right to terminate the contract,
> the **Insurer** shall not be liable to the **insured person** in respect of a relevant event occurring after the time of the fraudulent act. A relevant event is whatever gives rise to the **Insurer's** liability under the insurance contract (such as the occurrence of a loss, the making of a **claim**, or the notification of a potential **claim**); and,
> The **Insurer** need not return any of the premiums paid.

<a id='961eb684-ccda-41d8-88e8-dcaa35bf165a'></a>

Fraudulent **claims** – group insurance
If this insurance contract provides cover for any person who is not a party to the contract ("an **insured person**"), and a fraudulent **claim** is made under the contract by or on behalf of an **insured person**, the **Insurer** may exercise the rights set out as above as if there were an individual insurance contract between the **Insurer** and the **insured person**. However, the exercise of any of those rights shall not affect the cover provided under the contract for any other **insured person**.

<a id='0c41facc-e022-46f4-ac31-663f651807dd'></a>

## 8. Claims Conditions

Processes for making **claims**, **pre-authorisation** and **guarantees of payment** are different if **you** have purchased a DHA plan.
Please refer to 'Your Guide to Making a Claim' document sent with **your** Membership Guide for further details.

<a id='62a9d34a-ab28-4ce7-9e5d-5931cbacf659'></a>

8.1. **Pre-authorisation of claims**
**You** must contact **us** to request **pre-authorisation** and must be in receipt of confirmation from **us** in writing before **treatment** takes place.

<a id='73bac36e-1c68-4b0a-bb02-fd071cc93232'></a>

The minimum information required in order for **us** to give pre-
**authorisation** is:
* Medical diagnosis
* Name of treating facility and **doctor**
* Estimated cost of surgery
* Estimated length of stay

<a id='3b29f1b7-7211-457a-9024-1c9df1e3ea6d'></a>

Pre-authorisation must be obtained to receive **benefit** for the following services:

* Emergency medical evacuation
* Hospital treatment as an **in-patient**
* All maternity care including newborn care
* Hospice care
* Psychiatric treatment
* Rehabilitation for alcohol and drug addiction
* Cancer treatment
* Repatriation of mortal remains or local burial costs
* Over 7 sessions of Physiotherapy
* Rehabilitation treatment as an alternative to acute care
* Over 7 sessions of complementary therapy
* Out of geographic area cover for emergency treatment

<a id='cff7d349-0e8e-4883-9ee9-e75a539ad834'></a>

You should inform **us** at least 5 days before admission or any
treatment. In an **emergency** **you** (or someone acting for
**you**) should notify **us** within 24 hours of **hospital** admission.
Upon contacting us, **you** will be advised which documents

decline part of your claim if we have not pre-authorised
these benefits.

<a id='7fb6cfa5-9163-4456-876f-b8dde74d2f71'></a>

If **you** have not **pre-authorised**, **we** will only pay up to 80% of
what **we** consider to be **reasonable and customary** towards
**your claim**.

<a id='3a80cf36-c82a-4682-959a-a2252099dc9c'></a>

**You** are not covered for any costs of **emergency medical** evacuation that **we** did not **pre-authorise** and arrange.

<a id='d1e85694-d273-4cc9-b72f-882fea13e543'></a>

## 8.2 Guarantee of Payment (GOP)
If **you** require **in-patient treatment**, which must be **pre-authorised**, **we** can arrange to settle the costs directly with the **hospital**. This would normally involve **us** providing a **GOP** to the **hospital**, which the **hospital** accepts.

<a id='9e7bff66-f06f-4bb1-ae90-e7e9a7463d75'></a>

A **GOP** may also be provided to medical facilities where the value of **out-patient treatment** exceeds GBP300 (or equivalent) and if the facility is prepared to accept **our GOP**.

<a id='db9f6e42-e0e4-4e0e-955f-515124f61aa7'></a>

All necessary documentation relating to GOPs for non-emergency treatment must be received at least 5 days before the admission date to allow time for the 'guarantee' to be placed. In an emergency you (or someone acting on your behalf) should notify us within 24 hours of the hospital admission.

<a id='6e8cf211-8ed4-485d-b80f-2b720c5261b6'></a>

**GOPs** can only be placed where **treatment** is due to take place within 30 days of notification. **GOPs** will not be placed where **treatment** is due to take place after the expiry of the plan.

<a id='aef39969-b291-420c-8cbd-56246af15e7d'></a>

**GOPs** are placed in good faith and if later found to be for
**treatment** that is not eligible for cover then payment must be
refunded by **you**.

<a id='eb89f3a8-4cd7-480c-8b63-a18e5f83521c'></a>

We will settle eligible charges directly. Any costs not covered
(including excesses which are not paid by the member), which
remain unpaid, will result in future **GOPs** being declined.

<a id='8d72f55c-7e4f-4f13-ad55-f84e4e57ff77'></a>

In situations where a **hospital** does not accept **our GOP**,
treatment can either be sought at an alternative **hospital**
or **you** would need to pay for the **treatment** and submit a
reimbursement **claim** to **us** for these costs.

<a id='896081d4-c6ca-4a36-b24e-bd50fa34452a'></a>

8.3 **If your claim is covered by more than one insurance plan**
If at the time of any **claim(s)** covered by this plan there is any other insurance covering the same liability, the indemnity afforded by this plan will not apply except in the event that any limits afforded by such other insurance have been exceeded. Any amount in excess of such limit will be subject to the Limit of Liability as stated in the Membership Guide and on **your Insurance certificate**. This process helps to keep down the cost of **your** insurance.

<a id='b77d1c44-9ac5-482d-b0a3-1bd8e79d7f29'></a>

In these circumstances (where the originals have been submitted
to another Insurer) it will be sufficient to send us duplicates of
the invoices and documents. **We** will also require **you** to provide
contact details for the other Insurer.

<a id='1b602830-0151-49f4-a5dc-953c1a1a627d'></a>

**8.4 If your illness or injury was caused by someone else**
If **you** are claiming for an injury or illness caused by another person (or other people), **you** must tell **us** immediately. **We** have

<a id='7cd86e80-b78d-40fb-94ee-fb7a65502aff'></a>

the right to ask **you** to help **us** include the amount of **benefit**
**you** are claiming from **us** in **your claim** against another person.
This help may result in **us** prosecuting, defending or settling any
**claim** in **your** or **your dependants'** name for **our benefit**.

<a id='a43ccee3-9595-4b57-8b3d-2114327e8b02'></a>

8.5 Access to Medical Reports Act 1988
We may request reasonable information in support of **your**
**claim** and this includes medical reports. The Access to Medical
Reports Act requires that **we** advise **you** of **your** principle rights
under this Act.

<a id='1907e2cc-60da-4c0d-99ca-0d9276c6a198'></a>

Option 1
**You** may withhold **your** consent to an application for a report.
However, this may prevent **our** proceeding with **your claim**.

<a id='1bcb7057-a548-4581-878c-bfd79230cffe'></a>

Option 2
**You** may consent to the application but indicate that **you** wish to see the report. **Your doctor** will allow 21 days for **you** to see and approve it before it is supplied to **us**. If **your doctor** has not heard from **you** within 21 days, he or she will assume that **you** do not wish to see the report and that **you** consent to it being supplied.

<a id='9f7c7c6a-af9d-4edb-92d7-c8792966cb0a'></a>

When **you** see the report if there is anything in it in which **you** consider incorrect or misleading **you** can request (it must be in writing) that the **doctor** amend the report but he or she is not obliged to do so. If the **doctor** refuses to amend it **you** may:
* Withdraw consent for the report to be issued
* Ask the **doctor** to attach to the report a statement setting out **your** views
* Agree to the report being issued unchanged

<a id='93565dc1-dde3-4a29-9bbf-d827cb8c0ad8'></a>

Note: The **doctor** is not obliged to show **you** any parts of the report which he or she considers might cause serious damage to **your** physical or mental health or that of others, or which would reveal information about a third party who has supplied the **doctor** with information about **your** health unless the third party consents.

<a id='e7c9ef47-3a86-4de9-83a0-7083240495f5'></a>

In those circumstances the **doctor** will so inform **you** and **your** access to the report will be appropriately limited.

<a id='2ed653e8-31f9-4588-8ea4-1a9c3a519bf9'></a>

Option 3
**You** may consent to the application for the report but indicate
that **you** do not wish to see the report before it is supplied.
Should **you** change **your** mind after the application is made and
so notify the **doctor** in writing she/he should allow 21 days to
elapse after such notification so that **you** may arrange to have
access to the report (if the report has not already been supplied
before **you** change **your** mind).

<a id='c5e5d974-73b8-4384-ba5a-7e1021b151c4'></a>

Option 4
Whether or not **you** decide to seek access to the report before it
is supplied **you** have the right to seek access to it from the **doctor**
at any time up to 6 months after it was supplied.

<a id='2da286b2-2cc2-4ea7-8a33-32df0712ac61'></a>

**Your doctor** may charge a fee to cover the supply of a medical report, which is not covered by **your** plan.

<a id='027eabe4-9f99-4fa9-8718-1030acd4c5ef'></a>

## 8.6 Arbitration
Any differences of medical opinion on the results of an **accident** or illness will be settled between two medical experts appointed, in writing, by the two sides to the dispute. Any differences of opinion between the two medical experts will be referred to an
