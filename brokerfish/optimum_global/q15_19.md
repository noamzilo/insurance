15. Are there options where the insurance is with a large stable company? It seems Optimum global are small and new, which you advocate against.

 

I addressed this concern in my first email today. Trust that is ok?


16.  I couldn't find anywhere explicitly guaranteeing renewability of the insurance forever regardless of claims/ new medical condition/etc and that they can't "price me away" (have same price as anyone else). Possibly just missed it, but It is important.

 

This is always a very tricky part. We have seen even large companies such as Allianz Care and Bupa launching new products and keeping the old ones. This means the new applicants and the healthy ones transfer to the new and usually more affordable plans. Hence, the the to old and sick remains on the legacy plans. Hence no new blood is introduced to the old plans and as such the claim ratio goes up as the population is skewed and risk profile changes. This is also common in countries such as Germany where you have “tariff” groups. When such a group is closed and a new started, it means nothing good for the old population.

 

However, as a general rule we have not seen this often. Only with Allianz, Bupa, IMG and maybe a few more. Even if a company would write guaranteed renewal, they may just not offer the plan any more or just change the terms. It is very difficult to buy something that can last for life at a decent premium. I realize I am paining a bleak picture and my experience over my 20 years in the business is that the above is an exception to the rule but in the end there are never any guarantees. I prefer full disclosure no matter what and in the end that helps me sleep well at night (to not over promise).


17. sorry if i reeat this, I think i'm not: 
When I visit Israel (my country of citizenship) for weeks or months at a time, how is that treated? Is Israel covered as normal international coverage, or does "home country" / "country of citizenship" create any restriction or exclusion? I need to be able to spend extended time in Israel without losing coverage.

 

Your mobility and desire for home country treatment was the main reason for me to consider Optimum Global. They are rather flexible in terms of your location. As an example, we have set up policies for local nationals using their overseas holiday home address. The policies works and it is never an issue, it is just a regulatory circumvention allowing them to accept a policy on those terms. It is all communicated and confirmed at application stage so we are home free in this regard.

 

Expacare are on the other hand rather stringent in terms of flexibility to set up coverage. For you this means you must spend more than six months outside of Israel (as the country were you hold your passport, the home country).


18. I don't think the following was answered before: If I develop a serious ongoing condition — cancer requiring ongoing immunotherapy, MS, RA requiring biologics, kidney disease requiring dialysis — is treatment covered indefinitely for as long as my policy is active? Or is there a per-condition time limit or maximum treatment duration?

 

In general, you can claim up to your annual limit unless otherwise stated in the table of benefits or policy wording. Some benefits have a lifetime limit or a specific sub-limited which would then be stated in the documentation. Else, there is no cap on how long the treatment can continue.


19. is it possible to move between tiers/deductibles/cancel? What are the conditions? At renewal (only) you can lower your plan level or increase your deductible without any new underwriting. If you move in the other direction, upgrade your plan level or decrease your deductible new underwriting is required. Look at it as you having basic car insurance, experience a car crash and after that you want to try and increase your coverage… hope the analogy works! 😊
