We will pay any benefits due under this Policy either to the
Insured Person or where a Guarantee of Payment has been
placed to the providers of covered medical, transportation or
other services whose official receipt to pay that benefit will
discharge Us from the liability We have under the Policy. Only the
usual Reasonable and Customary Charges in the geographical
area where covered treatment or services are provided will be
paid. Satisfactory proof of claim must be submitted in all cases,
and We may appoint independent administrators to settle claims
on Our behalf.

Limits of Liability
The Company's liability is limited in amount to the sub-limits which the Benefit Table says applies to each item or type of cover provided. The annual limit per Insured Person stated in the Benefit Table is the maximum amount recoverable under the Policy as a whole in respect of any one Insured Person during any one Policy Year. If benefits are properly claimable after the date of termination or non-renewal of the Policy, the amounts payable shall be calculated as if the expenses had been incurred wholly during the preceding Policy Year.

any one Policy Year in excess of which the Policy will indemnify

<a id='6c3013ce-4461-4e1b-993f-524e87020af2'></a>

or compensate the Insured Person for medical expenses covered
by the Policy. In order to claim for any expense in excess of the
Deductible, the Insured Person must be able to substantiate that
the incurred expense said to fall within the Deductible would
have been covered by the Policy if the Deductible were not
applied.

<a id='04161de0-baa9-4166-ba5d-cb0dcf31460e'></a>

which are covered under the insurance.

which are not covered under the insurance and must be borne by

If the treatment is given as an emergency then You may not be able to contact Us beforehand. Do, however, ask someone to contact Us as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours of admission) and make sure that, when you are admitted to hospital, the hospital is given Your membership details and proof of identity so that they can contact Us straight away in order that a Guarantee of Payment may be placed.

Please note that failure to obtain pre-authorisation for scheduled surgery may result in a higher than expected charge for Your treatment which We may not be able to settle in full. In such case You will have to pay the difference.
