# International Health Insurance Comparison

**Profile:** Noam Salomonski, age 35, male, no fixed residence, Latin America base, Israeli + German dual citizenship. No plans for children. Priority: full outpatient coverage for cancer and non-cancer catastrophic illness (expensive chronic conditions, biologics, serious illness). Deductible acceptable.

---

## Plans Under Consideration

SafetyWing is **eliminated**: the $5,000/year hard cap on general outpatient means a serious non-cancer chronic condition (RA, MS, Crohn's, autoimmune disease requiring biologics) is effectively uncovered. Cancer itself has a separate benefit line, but everything else outpatient is capped at $5,000 — which one month of biologics can exhaust.

**The five relevant plans:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual max | Outpatient | Chronic outpatient |
|------|---------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Barmenia Plus** (NOMADS.insure) | ~$200 (€185) | **No Limit** | **No Limit** | No Limit (⚠️ Q15) |
| **Expacare Choices** (BrokerFish) | **~$317** ($850 deductible + lifestyle discount) | $10,000,000 | **Full Refund** | Full Refund (via cancer/chronic module) |
| **Genki Native Premium** | **$346** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** | No Limit (generic rule) |
| **Optimum Global Diamond** (BrokerFish) | ~$363 | $8,000,000 | **In Full** | In Full |
| **Expatriate Group Primary+** (BrokerFish) | **~$169** | $1,500,000 | Full (consultations/meds/imaging/cancer) | ⚠️ **$20,000/year** (chronic management only) |

Barmenia Best (€245/mo) adds nothing relevant for catastrophic illness — see end of document.
Genki Basic ($248/mo) has a €1,000,000 annual cap — inadequate if a serious illness runs multi-year.
Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers have outpatient caps that cannot handle expensive chronic illness — see end of document.
Expacare Choices = Core + Option 1 Cancer/Chronic Full + Option 2 Advanced Outpatient + Option 3 Dental/Wellness/Optical; Area 2 (worldwide excl. USA/Caribbean); $850 deductible; with lifestyle discount.
Expatriate Group Primary+ = WW excl. USA, $500 excess per condition per year, moratorium underwriting. Underwriter: Guardrisk Insurance Company Mauritius Ltd PCC.

## Renewability, Continuity & Premium Protection

**Note from Hans (Q16):** Even large companies like Allianz Care and Bupa have launched new products and migrated healthy customers to them, leaving sick customers on legacy "closed" plans where no new healthy lives join — causing claim ratios to worsen and premiums to spiral. This structural risk exists regardless of whether a contract says "guaranteed renewal." Hans has seen this with Allianz, Bupa, IMG, and a few others. He considers it an exception rather than the rule but notes there are never absolute lifetime guarantees.

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Expatriate Group Primary+ |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Renewability** | "This contract is not limited in time" — renews indefinitely | **"We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record"** — explicit | "Does not end with a certain age or after a certain period" — renews indefinitely. Insurer can only cancel for fraud/obligations violation, or full product discontinuation for all customers. | ⚠️ **Either party can terminate at any renewal with 30 days notice** (Membership Guide §8). No restriction on reason. | ⚠️ "We may cancel Your Policy with effect from the next renewal date by giving written notice" — no restriction on reason (§5 General Conditions) |
| **Age limit to join** | None stated | **Under 65** (individual policy) | None — explicitly documented | None stated | **Under 65** at Effective Date. Can renew indefinitely beyond 65. |
| **What happens at age 65** | Nothing — policy continues | Can no longer join; existing policy explicitly continues | Nothing — explicitly continues | Unknown | Can no longer join; existing policy can renew indefinitely "provided there is no break in cover" |
| **Premium increases with age** | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice required | Yes — age brackets published | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice; can cancel if increase is age-triggered | Yes — 30 days advance notice (§7a) | Yes — age brackets. Also: NCB mechanism means sick people effectively pay up to 20% more |

### Contractual Continuity & Premium Protection

**This is the single most important section for long-term catastrophic coverage.** Full policy wording review (not just TOB/brochures) reveals three fundamentally different contractual positions on whether an insurer can single you out after you become expensive:

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Expatriate Group Primary+ |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Can they single you out on premium?** | Not documented in available T&Cs | Contract says YES (§2.3), but senior Expacare confirmed informally: "not used as a discretionary repricing mechanism." **Practical risk low; contractual gap remains.** | **NO** — premiums adjusted "for all customers" (§5.5). Age brackets only (§5.4). | Hans says pool-wide. Contract says "We may vary... premium" (§7a) without explicit pool-wide restriction. | ⚠️ "We reserve the right to amend the Policy and premiums" at renewal (no restriction). **Plus: NCB mechanism creates de-facto individual pricing — sick people lose 20% discount.** |
| **Can they refuse to renew you?** | Not documented | **NO for age/health** — "We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record" (§2.4). | **NO** — only for fraud/obligations or full product discontinuation for everyone (§5.3). | ⚠️ **YES** — either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice, no restriction (§8). | ⚠️ **YES** — "We may cancel Your Policy with effect from the next renewal date" — no restriction stated. |
| **Can they change your terms individually?** | Not documented | ⚠️ **YES** — same §2.3 covers terms as well as premiums | **NO** — contract changes apply to everyone at yearly renewal. | ⚠️ **YES** — §4 allows amending cover/premium for "material changes" | ⚠️ **YES** — "Where any material change affects Your risk... We have the right to impose an amendment to cover, premium or withdraw cover altogether." |
| **Premium rating model** | Not documented | No community rating language. No pool-wide mechanism documented. | **Explicit pool-wide rating.** "Adjusts the prices for all customers." | No community rating language. | No community rating language. NCB acts as individual pricing mechanism (sick = no discount). |
| **Governing insurance law** | German VVG (strong) | UK FCA | **German VVG applies** (via Liechtenstein EEA + German operations) | Guernsey law (lighter) | **English law**, UK FCA (Strategic Insurance Services Ltd, FCA #307133). Underwriter: Guardrisk Insurance Mauritius (weaker backing than Lloyd's/AXA). |

**The Expacare contradiction — now clarified:** Expacare promises "We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record" — but in the same document reserves "the right to amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases." When challenged on this directly, a senior Expacare representative stated (via Hans, 27 Feb 2026): *"In practice, it is rarely exercised on policies mid-term and is not used as a discretionary repricing mechanism. Any changes would only occur in clearly defined circumstances (e.g. regulatory requirements or material underwriting factors)... The intention is to ensure compliance flexibility, not to introduce uncertainty for members."*

This is the most direct available answer. It is an informal written assurance, not a contractual amendment. Key caveats: (1) "mid-term" qualifier leaves renewal-time individual adjustment technically open; (2) "material underwriting factors" is undefined and potentially broad; (3) it is not binding on the insurer. The practical risk of individual singling appears low based on this response, but zero contractual protection against it remains.

**The OG gap — partially clarified:** Hans's position is that OG §7a changes are pool-wide ("related to everyone on cover, not you as an individual"). Historical example: OG upgraded all policyholders on an old low-coverage plan to USD 1M/USD 500 outpatient. §8 termination is framed as a standard business-exit clause for when an insurer exits a market. However, the contract language still does not say "for all insured persons" — Genki's does explicitly. The pool-wide assurance for OG remains Hans's interpretation, not confirmed in the contract text.

**The Genki protection:** Genki is the only insurer whose contract commits to pool-wide-only premium adjustment ("for all customers"). Combined with the cancellation protections (only for fraud or full product discontinuation), this is the strongest contractual continuity position. The trade-off: Genki is a group policy (you're not a direct contracting party) and their insurer has changed twice.

## 2. Outpatient — The Critical Section

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Expatriate Group Primary+ |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Annual outpatient cap** | **No Limit** | **Full Refund** (no cap, within $10M policy max) | **No Limit** | **In Full** (no cap, within $8M policy max) | Full for consultations/cancer/imaging; ⚠️ **$20,000/year chronic condition management** |
| **GP / specialist visits** | 100% | Full refund | Covered | In Full | ✓ Covered (no sub-limit) |
| **Prescribed medications (general)** | 100% | Full refund (Advanced level). Cancer/chronic meds handled separately. | Covered — generic equivalent rule applies¹ | In Full | ✓ Covered (prescribed only) |
| **Lab / imaging (CT, MRI, PET)** | 100% | Full refund (CT/MRI/PET explicitly listed) | Covered | In Full | ✓ Covered |
| **Emergency room (outpatient)** | Covered | Full refund | Covered | In Full | Covered |
| **Chronic condition meds (outpatient)** | 100%, no cap ⚠️ see Q15 | ✅ Full refund via Cancer/Chronic module (Advanced Outpatient) ⚠️ see note² | Covered, no sub-cap — generic rule¹ | **In Full, confirmed** | ⚠️ **$20,000/year total for all chronic condition management** — one month of biologics can exhaust this |
| **Free choice of doctors** | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes ("no restrictions on the doctor or medical facility") | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes | Yes (specialist requires physician referral) |

¹ *Generic equivalent rule (Genki):* Genki reimburses medication up to the cost of the cheapest available generic. If a generic exists for a drug, you cover the brand-name premium out of pocket. If no generic exists — which is the case for most modern targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and biologics — the rule does not apply and the full cost is covered.

² *Expacare chronic condition prescriptions:* The standard outpatient prescription benefit explicitly "excludes medication for cancer, maternity and psychiatric conditions." However, outpatient prescriptions for chronic conditions are covered under the Cancer & Chronic Full Cover module, which states outpatient treatment and prescriptions for chronic conditions are "subject to the out-patient benefit limits of the out-patient option selected." With Advanced Outpatient selected, this = full refund. Cancer medications are covered under the cancer treatment line (full refund), not the prescription drug line.

## 10. Open Questions Before Signing

| Question | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **⚠️ Q15 — Oncology specialty drugs** | Must get written confirmation: does "Medication 100%" cover biologics, immunotherapy, targeted oral cancer drugs? This is the single blocking question. If yes → equivalent to Expacare/Diamond. If no → serious cancer drug gap. | ✅ Cancer treatment (full refund, outpatient) covers cancer drugs. ATMPs ($500k lifetime cap) for gene/cell therapies. Standard biologics/immunotherapy covered under cancer treatment line — **no separate cap.** ⚠️ **§6.20 risk**: "experimental treatment" is excluded using the UK as a guide — a cutting-edge drug not yet standard in UK practice could be refused. | Generic rule: no issue for modern drugs with no generic (most cancer drugs). Potential out-of-pocket cost only for drugs where a generic exists. | ✅ Confirmed in full — explicit TOB line, no ambiguity. |
| **⚠️ Israel/Germany home country** | Does German citizenship trigger a second 180-day limit, splitting the allowance? | ⚠️ Rule is **per country, not cumulative** per Hans (27 Feb). Germany and Israel each have their own separate 6-month limit. Not yet verified against Expacare contract language. Practical implication: as long as you spend <6 months in Israel AND <6 months in Germany separately, both are fine. | ✅ Both Israel and Germany get unlimited Full Country Coverage. No issue. | Not a concern per Hans — OG uses declared address, not passport-based home country. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | ⚠️ Not documented — likely reimbursement | ✅ Healix/Expacare direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist pays hospital directly | ✅ AXA payment guarantee |
| **Minimum contract / exit** | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ✅ Annual; pro-rated refund if no claims | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ✅ Now documented: annual, either party can terminate at renewal with 30 days notice (§8). |
| **Renewability at older age** | ✅ No cutoff stated | ✅ **Explicit: "will not cancel because of age or health record"** | ✅ Explicitly no cutoff | ⚠️ **No protection.** Policy auto-renews if plan still available (§7a), but OG can terminate at any renewal (§8) or vary premium/terms without restriction. |
| **⚠️ Individual premium singling** | Not documented | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" (§2.3) | ✅ **Contract prohibits it** — adjustments are "for all customers" only (§5.5) | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "may vary benefits, cover and/or premium" at renewal (§7a), no pool-wide restriction |

# What Extra Money Buys

## Expatriate Group Primary+ (~$169/mo) — Eliminated for Catastrophic Chronic Illness

Introduced by Hans (27 Feb 2026). Hans and his wife are personally on this plan. Full policy wording reviewed.

**Provider:** Expatriate Group (trading style of Strategic Insurance Services Ltd, UK). Underwriter: **Guardrisk Insurance Company Mauritius Ltd PCC** (Mauritius, FSC regulated). UK FCA authorised (FCA #307133). English law. Serving since 1997.

**Underwriting**: Moratorium — no health questions on application. Pre-existing conditions = anything with symptoms, treatment, or advice in the **2 years prior to start date** — automatically excluded. Can become covered once you've been **symptom/treatment/advice-free for 24 consecutive months** following your Effective Date. This means a condition you're actively managing at signup is excluded for at least 2 years.

**NCB**: Up to 20% no-claim bonus (10% after 1 year, 15% after 2 years, 20% after 3+ years). Sick people lose this discount — de facto individual pricing through the NCB mechanism. New customers can bring NCB from prior insurer.

**Premium history**: Only once increased in 7–8 years per Hans. Premium is "guaranteed for a 12-month period." Policy changes (including premiums) can be made at renewal.

**Claims scrutiny**: "They do ask more questions related to claims once submitted" (Hans). The reason Hans didn't recommend this plan earlier.

| Key Benefit | Primary+ | Impact |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Annual max** | **$1,500,000** | Lowest of all plans — multi-year catastrophic illness could approach or exceed this |
| **Chronic condition management (outpatient)** | **$20,000/year** | ⚠️ **Primary dealbreaker.** One year of RA biologics: $30k–$80k. One month of some cancer immunotherapy: >$20k. |
| **Organ transplant** | **$150,000 lifetime** | Very low (Expacare: $3.4M; OG: In Full; Genki: In Full) |
| **Palliative care** | **$20,000 lifetime** | Very low |
| **Cancer treatment (inpatient + outpatient)** | ✓ Full (separate benefit line; not subject to $20k cap) | Better than initially implied — cancer itself is covered to policy max |
| **Oncology drugs** | ✓ Covered (as part of cancer treatment) | OK for cancer; problem is non-cancer chronic conditions |
| **Excess structure** | **$500 per new condition per year** | Not aggregate — each new diagnosis triggers a separate $500. Manageable if one big condition; worse with multiple. |
| **Home country (Israel + Germany)** | ⚠️ "Country for which You hold a passport" | Same restriction as Expacare — must live outside home country |
| **USA** | $50,000/trip, max 30 days | Emergency only; lower limit than others |
| **Emergency assistance** | Own 24/7 line | No named major provider (Healix/AXA/MCI) |
| **Pre-auth** | Required 7 days in advance for inpatient + claims >$1,000 | Standard |

**Why eliminated:** The $20,000/year chronic outpatient management cap is the dealbreaker for the stated purpose (catastrophic long-term illness, biologics, expensive chronic conditions). One month of many biologic therapies for RA, MS, or Crohn's exceeds this. For pure cancer treatment, it is better covered (cancer has its own benefit line), but the $1.5M policy max and $150k organ transplant are still significantly lower than competitors. The NCB mechanism creates de facto individual pricing — a person claiming annually for a serious condition will never accumulate the NCB, paying up to 20% more than a healthy person over time. The moratorium underwriting means anything you currently have is excluded for 2 years. The "may cancel at next renewal date" clause provides no stronger protection than OG.

**One genuine advantage**: The moratorium underwriting means no health questionnaire upfront — if you have undisclosed conditions, you simply wait 2 years for them to become covered if claim-free. Better than FMU (Expacare) if you have something borderline you don't want assessed.

## SafetyWing ($161/mo) — Eliminated

SafetyWing covers cancer treatment at 100% under its own benefit line. However, all other outpatient costs — including specialist visits, medications, and chronic illness treatment — are subject to a $5,000/year hard cap. One month of biologics for RA, MS, or Crohn's can cost $3,000–$8,000. SafetyWing is eliminated because it cannot protect against catastrophic non-cancer outpatient costs.

## Barmenia Plus (~$200/mo) vs Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) — +$117/month

| Benefit | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Impact |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ⚠️ Q15 open | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Significant if Q15 comes back negative for Barmenia. |
| **Renewability certainty** | Explicitly indefinite (contract) | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** | Expacare is more explicit and individual-contract-based. |
| **Israel home country** | 180 days/year | ⚠️ >6 months outside required — hard restriction | If you spend significant time in Israel, Expacare may not be appropriate at all. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | Not documented | ✅ Healix direct settlement | High in practice. |
| **Insurer stability** | ⚠️ Newer product; "travel insurance" label | ✅ 40+ years; Lloyd's backed; IPMI | Expacare is more established and better classified. |
| **You are a direct party** | ⚠️ No — group member only | ✅ Yes — individual policy | Expacare gives you direct legal standing. |
| **Product classification** | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | Long-term IPMI | Expacare is better structured for long-term serious illness. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $10,000,000 | Barmenia is strictly better here for multi-decade catastrophic scenarios. |

**Verdict on +$117/month for Expacare over Barmenia:** Justified if: (a) Q15 is not confirmed in writing for Barmenia, (b) you want an individual policy with direct legal standing, (c) you want 40+ year Lloyd's-backed stability. Major caveat: if you plan to spend significant time in Israel, **Expacare may be incompatible** — the >6 months outside rule is a hard product eligibility requirement, not a coverage limitation.

---

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Genki Premium ($346/mo) — +$29/month for Genki

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Israel home country** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | **Unlimited** | **High if you plan significant Israel stays.** This alone may eliminate Expacare for Noam. |
| **Germany home country** | ⚠️ Same >6 months restriction (German passport = home country) | **Unlimited** | Same concern as Israel. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | "Will not cancel because of age or health record" — explicit, individual contract | "Does not end with a certain age" — explicit, but group contract | Both protect against cancellation. Expacare's is on an individual policy. |
| **Individual premium singling** | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" | **✅ Contract prohibits it** — adjustments are "for all customers" only | **Genki is stronger on the pricing-out risk.** Expacare can't cancel you but can individually raise your premium. Genki can do neither. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | **No Limit** | Genki is better — no ceiling at all. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Generic rule (minimal risk for modern drugs) | Both acceptable; Expacare has a small ATMP caveat. |
| **Claims handler** | **Expacare directly** (no DR-WALTER) | DR-WALTER (documented multi-month delay) | Expacare is clearly better on claims reliability. |
| **Insurer stability** | 40+ years; Lloyd's | ⚠️ Changed insurers twice; Squarelife since 2021 | Expacare is more stable. |
| **You are a direct party** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ No — group member | Expacare is better. |
| **Product classification** | Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Tied — both correctly classified. |

**Verdict:** For just $29/month more, Genki Premium buys unlimited Israel and Germany coverage, no policy maximum, and — critically — **the only contractual protection against individual premium singling.** Genki's "for all customers" pricing means they cannot raise your premium because you became expensive. Expacare's contract explicitly reserves this right. If long-term continuity after a catastrophic illness is the priority, Genki's contractual protections outweigh Expacare's advantages in insurer stability and claims handling. If you're confident you'll stay under 6 months/year in both passport countries and weigh insurer track record above contractual language, Expacare remains strong.

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond (~$363/mo) — +$46/month for Diamond

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Israel coverage** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | Not documented; Paraguay workaround used | Both uncertain/restricted; neither is clean. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** — explicit | ⚠️ **No protection.** Either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice, no restriction (§8). | **Expacare is categorically better.** OG can walk away; Expacare cannot cancel you for health. |
| **Individual premium singling** | ⚠️ Contract permits it (§2.3) | ⚠️ Contract permits it (§7a) | Both can single you out. Neither offers pool-wide pricing protection. |
| **Insurer backing** | **Lloyd's of London** | AXA (reinsurer) | Both strong; different flavors. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | $8,000,000 | Expacare is slightly better. |
| **USA planned treatment** | Emergency only, 6 weeks | **In Full, 45 days including planned treatment** | Diamond better if US access is important. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Full under cancer module | ✅ Confirmed full — no ambiguity | Tied. |
| **Claims track record** | No documented problems; Hans 10+ years | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines (18+ years) | Diamond slightly better documented. |
| **Emergency assistance** | Healix (British Foreign Services) | AXA (very large global network) | Both excellent. |
| **Product age** | 40+ years | Stable since ~2017 | Expacare is longer established. |

**Verdict:** At $46/month more, Diamond buys better USA planned treatment coverage and slightly better documented claims reliability. But Expacare is now clearly superior on continuity: it has an explicit no-cancellation guarantee for age/health (even if it can still individually adjust premiums), while OG has no such protection — either party can terminate at any renewal for any reason. Both can individually adjust premiums. If long-term continuity matters, Expacare is the better choice of these two.

## Genki Premium ($346/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond ($363/mo) — +$17/month

Only $17/month difference. Diamond buys over Genki Premium:

| Benefit | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Oncology specialty drugs** | Covered; generic rule applies (minimal risk for modern drugs) | **Confirmed in full, no generic rule, zero ambiguity** | If you want absolute certainty on cancer drug coverage, Diamond closes this entirely. |
| **USA coverage** | 28-day emergency only (life-threatening) | **In Full, up to 45 days, including planned treatment** | High if you plan to see US specialists or travel to the US for treatment. |
| **AXA emergency network** | MCI Assist (strong; direct hospital payment) | AXA (very large global network; direct hospital payment) | Marginal difference in practice for LatAm. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $8,000,000 | Genki Premium is strictly better here — No Limit vs $8M cap. |
| **Israel coverage** | Unlimited | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki Premium is strictly better. |
| **Regulatory** | Liechtenstein FMA + German VVG | UK FCA / Guernsey | German VVG provides stronger statutory consumer protection for health insurance. |
| **Renewability** | Explicitly indefinite; cannot cancel for claims | ⚠️ **Either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice** (§8) | **Genki is categorically better.** |
| **Individual premium singling** | **✅ Contract prohibits it** — "for all customers" only | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — no restriction | **Genki is categorically better.** This is the decisive difference for catastrophic long-term coverage. |

**Verdict on +$17/month:** Diamond buys complete oncology drug certainty (no generic rule) and full USA planned treatment coverage. But Genki Premium wins on every long-term protection metric: pool-wide pricing (cannot single you out), cannot cancel for claims, unlimited Israel, no policy max. For someone buying insurance primarily for catastrophic long-term coverage, **Genki's contractual protections are worth more than Diamond's within-year benefit advantages.** Diamond makes sense only if US access is a hard requirement.

## Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers — Eliminated

| Tier | Monthly | Problem |
|------|---------|---------|
| Emerald | ~$154 | $500 total outpatient budget. Worthless for serious chronic illness. |
| Sapphire | ~$170 | Zero outpatient (except diagnostics). Worse than Emerald for outpatient. |
| Ruby | ~$264 | $3,500 total outpatient. One month of expensive biologics wipes it out. |
| Jade | ~$331 | $10,000 total outpatient. Better, but one year of RA/MS biologics ($15k–$80k) still exceeds it. |

All four tiers are eliminated. Cancer is covered In Full on all Optimum Global tiers including Emerald. The problem is everything else outpatient — all non-cancer chronic illness, specialist visits, and medications are capped, and the caps are too low for serious illness.

---

## Barmenia Best (€245/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) — +€60/month

For your concerns (catastrophic illness, cancer): **identical**. Best adds no additional protection for serious illness whatsoever.

What the €60/month (€720/year) buys:
- Preventive checkups and vaccinations (cheap in LatAm; €100–300 value/year)
- 2× dental cleanings/year (€30–120 value depending on country)
- 50% dental prosthetics — meaningful if you need a crown or bridge (€300–750 saved per tooth)
- Full outpatient psychotherapy vs 3 sessions — meaningful if you need ongoing mental health support
- Outpatient rehabilitation — meaningful if you need physio after injury/surgery (could be €2,000–5,000 in a bad year)

**Verdict:** Start with Plus. The €720/year extra only pays off in specific events (dental reconstruction, injury rehab, ongoing therapy). If none of those apply in a given year, you've overpaid by €720 for benefits you could cover out of pocket cheaply in LatAm.

| Germany stays | ⚠️ unclear | ⚠️ Per Hans: same per-country 6-month rule | **Unlimited** | Not a concern | ⚠️ Same restriction as Israel |
| Direct hospital payment | ⚠️ unclear | ✅ Healix direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist | ✅ AXA | ⚠️ Not documented; no named GOP provider |

| Regulatory protection | **BaFin (best)** | **UK FCA** | Liechtenstein / German VVG | UK FCA / Guernsey | **UK FCA** / Mauritius |
| You are a direct party | ⚠️ No | **✅ Yes** | ⚠️ No | ✅ Yes | **✅ Yes** |
| Product classification | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | ✅ Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Long-term international health | IPMI |
| Insurer backing | Barmenia (BaFin) | **Lloyd's of London** | Squarelife + Genki | AXA reinsurer | ⚠️ **Guardrisk Mauritius** |
| Claims track record | No data | ✅ 10+ years; no documented issues | ⚠️ Multi-month delay (Sep 2025) | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines | Hans personally uses it. ⚠️ "More questions on submitted claims." |

**The decision tree:**

1. **Long-term continuity test (most important for catastrophic coverage):**
   - **OG Diamond** has the weakest contractual continuity of all four plans. The policy permits individual premium adjustment, individual terms changes, and outright termination at any renewal with 30 days notice for any reason. If long-term continuity after becoming sick is your top priority, **OG is the riskiest choice contractually** despite Hans's experience that it doesn't happen.
   - **Expacare** cannot cancel you for age or health, but CAN individually adjust your premium and terms — creating a "pricing out" risk. Stronger than OG, but not bulletproof.
   - **Genki Premium** is the only plan that contractually commits to pool-wide-only pricing ("for all customers") and cannot cancel except for fraud or full product discontinuation. Strongest continuity protection. Trade-off: group policy (not a direct party), insurer changed twice.
   - **Barmenia Plus** — continuity protections not documented in available T&Cs.

2. **Israel and Germany time test:**
   - **Expacare**: The 6-month rule is **per country, not cumulative** per Hans (27 Feb). Israel and Germany are evaluated separately. As long as you don't spend more than 6 months in either country individually, both are covered. Unverified against contract language but this is Hans's explicit answer.
   - **OG**: Germany is not a concern — OG uses declared address as home country, not passport. The Paraguay workaround addresses Israel. Both are informal arrangements.
   - **Genki**: No restriction on either country.

3. **Get Q15 answered by Christoph in writing** (for Barmenia Plus):
   - If **yes** (Barmenia covers oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus at $200/mo is the clear value winner on price. But weigh the risk factors below.
   - If **no** (Barmenia does not cover oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus is eliminated for cancer risk. Choose from Expacare, Genki Premium, or Diamond.

4. **Risk factors for Barmenia Plus / COVRD.EE:**
   - **"Travel insurance" classification**: COVRD.EE's own documents call it an *"international travel group health insurance policy."* This may mean travel-style rules rather than long-term health insurance rules.
   - **You are not a direct party to the contract**: All rights/obligations exist between DR-WALTER and Barmenia only. No direct legal standing against Barmenia.
   - **DR-WALTER claims concentration risk**: DR-WALTER handles claims for both COVRD.EE and Genki. A documented Genki claim (September 2025) went unresolved for months.
   - **Product youth**: COVRD.EE from a small Estonian broker is a newer distribution arrangement.

5. **Expacare Choices as a middle path** (if Israel/Germany time is not a concern):
   - At ~$317/month, it sits between Barmenia and Genki/Diamond.
   - Strengths: explicit no-cancellation guarantee for age/health; 40-year Lloyd's-backed insurer; individual policy; Healix emergency assistance; clean claims handler.
   - ⚠️ New concern: "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" means they can price you out without formally cancelling you. The no-cancellation clause protects against termination but not against unaffordable individual premium increases.
   - Trade-offs vs Genki: home country restrictions; $10M cap vs no limit; $500k ATMP lifetime cap; no pool-wide pricing protection.
   - Trade-offs vs Diamond: no USA planned treatment; slightly more expensive at nil excess.

6. **Expatriate Group Primary+ — assessed and eliminated:**
   - At ~$169/month it is the cheapest option. No health questions (moratorium underwriting).
   - **Eliminated** because: $20,000/year chronic outpatient management cap (biologics alone can exceed this in one month); $150,000 organ transplant lifetime cap; $1,500,000 annual maximum (lowest of all plans); "may cancel at renewal" with no restriction; NCB creates de facto individual pricing (sick people pay 20% more over time); weaker underwriter (Guardrisk Mauritius vs. Lloyd's/AXA).
   - Cancer treatment itself is better covered than initial impression — it has its own benefit line not subject to the $20k cap. But the non-cancer catastrophic chronic illness scenario is inadequately covered.
   - One potential niche: if you have pre-existing conditions you don't want assessed, the moratorium underwriting means no questionnaire — just a 2-year exclusion window rather than permanent exclusion after FMU.

7. **Current state after Hans's Feb 27 responses:**
   - **Expacare's "individual cases" clause** has been clarified informally by a senior Expacare representative: "not used as a discretionary repricing mechanism... compliance flexibility, not uncertainty for members." This does not eliminate the contractual gap but substantially reduces the practical concern. Hans recommends Expacare among the three within budget.
   - **OG §7a** is asserted by Hans to be pool-wide, not individual, with a concrete historical example. The contract text still does not say "for all insured persons" explicitly, but the practical position is similar to Expacare.
   - **Germany** is confirmed by Hans as a separate limit per country, not cumulative with Israel — this removes the compounding concern for Expacare.
   - **Genki Premium** still has the strongest contractual language on all three dimensions (pool-wide pricing explicit in contract, no individual cancellation, German VVG backstop), but the Expacare practical gap has narrowed significantly based on the senior staff clarification.
   - **Hans's recommendation**: Expacare, "much more benefit rich and the deductible is annual. You could even remove the deductible and it is almost within budget."
