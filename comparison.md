# International Health Insurance Comparison

**Profile:** Noam Salomonski, age 35, male, no fixed residence, Latin America base, Israeli + German dual citizenship. No plans for children. Priority: full outpatient coverage for cancer and non-cancer catastrophic illness (expensive chronic conditions, biologics, serious illness). Deductible acceptable.

---

## Plans Under Consideration

SafetyWing is **eliminated**: the $5,000/year hard cap on general outpatient means a serious non-cancer chronic condition (RA, MS, Crohn's, autoimmune disease requiring biologics) is effectively uncovered. Cancer itself has a separate benefit line, but everything else outpatient is capped at $5,000 — which one month of biologics can exhaust.

**The four relevant plans:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual max | Outpatient |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Barmenia Plus** (NOMADS.insure) | ~$200 (€185) | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Expacare Choices** (BrokerFish) | **~$317** ($850 deductible + lifestyle discount) | $10,000,000 | **Full Refund** |
| **Genki Native Premium** | **$346** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Optimum Global Diamond** (BrokerFish) | ~$363 | $8,000,000 | **In Full** |

Barmenia Best (€245/mo) adds nothing relevant for catastrophic illness — see end of document.
Genki Basic ($248/mo) has a €1,000,000 annual cap — inadequate if a serious illness runs multi-year.
Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers have outpatient caps that cannot handle expensive chronic illness — see end of document.
Expacare Choices = Core + Option 1 Cancer/Chronic Full + Option 2 Advanced Outpatient + Option 3 Dental/Wellness/Optical; Area 2 (worldwide excl. USA/Caribbean); $850 deductible; with lifestyle discount.

## Renewability & Age Limits

**Note from Hans (Q16):** Even large companies like Allianz Care and Bupa have launched new products and migrated healthy customers to them, leaving sick customers on legacy "closed" plans where no new healthy lives join — causing claim ratios to worsen and premiums to spiral. This structural risk exists regardless of whether a contract says "guaranteed renewal." Hans has seen this with Allianz, Bupa, IMG, and a few others. He considers it an exception rather than the rule but notes there are never absolute lifetime guarantees.

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Renewability** | "This contract is not limited in time" — renews indefinitely | **"We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record"** — explicit | "Does not end with a certain age or after a certain period" — renews indefinitely | Not stated in TOB or emails ⚠️ |
| **Age limit to join** | None stated | **Under 65** (individual policy) | None — explicitly documented | None stated ⚠️ |
| **What happens at age 65** | Nothing — policy continues | Can no longer join new policy; but existing policy explicitly continues — "will not cancel because of age" | Nothing — policy explicitly continues regardless of age | Unknown ⚠️ |
| **Premium increases with age** | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice required | Yes — age brackets published | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice; can cancel if increase is age-triggered | Yes — not documented how |

All four plans increase premiums as you age into the next bracket. None cut off existing members at any age (Expacare most explicitly guaranteed on this). The age-65 join limit on Expacare only matters if you are not yet a member — at 35, this is not relevant. For planning purposes, the renewability question is about policy language for existing members, which Expacare explicitly protects.

## 1. Provider Identity

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Your contract is with** | **Nobody directly.** DR-WALTER GmbH is the policyholder and holds the group contract with Barmenia. T&Cs state: *"rights and obligations arising from this contract exist exclusively between the policyholder and the insurer."* You join as an insured member under DR-WALTER's group policy, not as a direct contracting party. | **Expacare Limited** (UK) — direct individual policy. You are the policyholder. | **Nobody directly.** Genki is the policyholder and holds the group contract with Squarelife. Same structure as Barmenia — you are an insured member under Genki's group policy. | **Optimum Global Limited** (UK) — you are a direct individual policyholder. Risk is carried by **Optimum Global Insurance Company Limited** (Guernsey). Two distinct OG entities; UK entity is your counterparty, Guernsey entity carries the risk. |
| **Who actually pays claims** | **Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG** (Germany), administered by DR-WALTER GmbH | **Expacare** directly (their own in-house claims team); **Healix** for emergency assistance | **Squarelife Insurance AG** (Liechtenstein), administered by Genki | **Optimum Global** (UK / Guernsey) |
| **Insurer** | **Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG** (Germany, BaFin regulated) | **Lloyd's of London** syndicates | Squarelife (Liechtenstein) | Optimum Global Insurance Co. Ltd (Guernsey) |
| **Backing** | Medicator AG (German insolvency protection fund) | **Lloyd's of London** (world's leading specialist insurance market) | — | **AXA** (reinsurer + emergency payment guarantees) |
| **Broker / platform** | NOMADS.insure (Herrmann, Huebner & Partner; Estonian broker) / DR-WALTER GmbH (German policyholder & claims handler) | **BrokerFish (Hans Benn; Labuan FSA licensed)** | Genki GmbH (German startup; policyholder, agent & claims handler for Squarelife) | BrokerFish (Hans Benn; Labuan FSA licensed) |
| **Claims handler** | **DR-WALTER GmbH** (same company handles claims for both COVRD.EE and Genki — single point of failure for two of the four products) | **Expacare directly** (their own team) | **DR-WALTER GmbH** (same as above — see claims section) | **Optimum Global** directly |
| **Emergency assistance** | Not specified ⚠️ | **Healix** (24/7; direct hospital settlement; same provider used by British Foreign Services for all overseas staff) | **MCI Assist** (24/7; pays hospital directly, no bill to you) | **AXA** (24/7; issues direct payment guarantee to hospital) |
| **Regulatory protection** | **BaFin (strongest in EU)** + free PKV Ombudsman for disputes | **UK FCA** (Expacare Limited authorised and regulated by FCA) | Liechtenstein FMA (EEA-passported) | UK FCA / Labuan FSA (broker) |
| **Jurisdiction** | **German law** | UK | Liechtenstein / German VVG applies | UK |
| **Product classification** | ⚠️ **"International travel group health insurance"** — the document's own label. Travel-style classification may mean travel-style rules: different exclusion sets, stricter pre-existing condition treatment, and claims processes designed for trips rather than long-term illness. | **International Private Medical Insurance (IPMI)** — explicitly positioned as long-term expat health. Expacare branding: "we're in it for the long term." | Long-term expat / remote worker health insurance — explicitly positioned as permanent coverage | Long-term international health insurance — established product with stable insurer since ~2017 |
| **Insurer / product stability** | ⚠️ COVRD.EE is a relatively new product from a small Estonian broker. Barmenia is a large, established insurer, but the distribution arrangement is young. | **40+ years established; Lloyd's-backed.** Hans has worked with Expacare for 10+ years. | ⚠️ Genki has already changed insurers twice: Barmenia → Allianz → Squarelife (current). Product has been restructured. | **Optimum Global has been operating since the 1990s; moved to self-insure (with AXA reinsurance) around 2017. Stable structure.** |

## 2. Outpatient — The Critical Section

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Annual outpatient cap** | **No Limit** | **Full Refund** (no cap, within $10M policy max) | **No Limit** | **In Full** (no cap, within $8M policy max) |
| **GP / specialist visits** | 100% | Full refund | Covered | In Full |
| **Prescribed medications (general)** | 100% | Full refund (Advanced level). ⚠️ Note: cancer and chronic meds are handled under their own module, not this line — see Section 3. | Covered — generic equivalent rule applies¹ | In Full |
| **Lab / imaging (CT, MRI, PET)** | 100% | Full refund (CT/MRI/PET explicitly listed in Core) | Covered | In Full |
| **Emergency room (outpatient)** | Covered | Full refund | Covered | In Full |
| **Chronic condition meds (outpatient)** | 100%, no cap ⚠️ see Q15 below | ✅ Covered under Cancer/Chronic Full Cover module — outpatient chronic prescriptions follow the outpatient benefit level = full refund with Advanced ⚠️ see note below² | Covered, no sub-cap — generic rule¹ | **In Full, confirmed, no ambiguity** |
| **Free choice of doctors** | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes ("no restrictions on the doctor or medical facility that you want to attend") | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes |

¹ *Generic equivalent rule (Genki):* Genki reimburses medication up to the cost of the cheapest available generic. If a generic exists for a drug, you cover the brand-name premium out of pocket. If no generic exists — which is the case for most modern targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and biologics — the rule does not apply and the full cost is covered.

² *Expacare chronic condition prescriptions:* The standard outpatient prescription benefit explicitly "excludes medication for cancer, maternity and psychiatric conditions." However, outpatient prescriptions for chronic conditions are covered under the Cancer & Chronic Full Cover module, which states outpatient treatment and prescriptions for chronic conditions are "subject to the out-patient benefit limits of the out-patient option selected." With Advanced Outpatient selected, this = full refund. Cancer medications are covered under the cancer treatment line (full refund), not the prescription drug line.

Expatriate = living outside home country >6 months/year. You must spend >6 months/year outside Israel. No workaround.** | **Full Country Coverage — unlimited days, no restriction** | Not explicitly documented ⚠️ (Paraguay address used as workaround) |
| **Germany (dual citizenship)** | ⚠️ Q17 unanswered: does Germany also trigger 180-day limit, splitting allowance between two countries? | ⚠️ **Germany is also a home country (you hold a German passport). Same >6 months/year outside rule likely applies to Germany as well, compounding the Israel restriction.** | **Full Country Coverage — same unlimited treatment as Israel** | Not addressed ⚠️ |

Telephone consultations are covered. | Pay and submit to Squarelife for reimbursement | Pay and submit to Optimum Global for reimbursement (~2 weeks) |
| **Hospitalization** | Reimbursement (process not documented ⚠️) | **Healix/Expacare negotiates direct settlement of hospital bills** (pre-authorisation required) | **MCI Assist pays hospital directly — you pay nothing** | **AXA issues payment guarantee to hospital — you pay nothing** |

## 10. Open Questions Before Signing

| Question | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **⚠️ Q15 — Oncology specialty drugs** | Must get written confirmation: does "Medication 100%" cover biologics, immunotherapy, targeted oral cancer drugs? This is the single blocking question. If yes → equivalent to Expacare/Diamond. If no → serious cancer drug gap. | ✅ Cancer treatment (full refund, outpatient) covers cancer drugs. ATMPs ($500k lifetime cap) for gene/cell therapies. Standard biologics/immunotherapy covered under cancer treatment line — **no separate cap.** ⚠️ **§6.20 risk**: "experimental treatment" is excluded using the UK as a guide — a cutting-edge drug not yet standard in UK practice could be refused. | Generic rule: no issue for modern drugs with no generic (most cancer drugs). Potential out-of-pocket cost only for drugs where a generic exists. | ✅ Confirmed in full — explicit TOB line, no ambiguity. |
| **⚠️ Israel/Germany home country** | Does German citizenship trigger a second 180-day limit, splitting the allowance? | ⚠️ **Hard restriction for both countries.** Must confirm with Hans: does the >6-months rule apply to each passport country separately, or cumulatively? If cumulative, Israel + Germany together must be < 6 months/year total. | ✅ Both Israel and Germany get unlimited Full Country Coverage. No issue. | ⚠️ Not addressed. Paraguay address workaround confirmed by Hans. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | ⚠️ Not documented — likely reimbursement | ✅ Healix/Expacare direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist pays hospital directly | ✅ AXA payment guarantee |
| **Minimum contract / exit** | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ✅ Annual; pro-rated refund if no claims | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ⚠️ Not stated |
| **Renewability at older age** | ✅ No cutoff stated | ✅ **Explicit: "will not cancel because of age or health record"** | ✅ Explicitly no cutoff | ⚠️ Not stated |
| **Ongoing illness duration** | No time cap confirmed by Hans (Q18): treatment covered up to annual limit, each year it renews, as long as policy is active | Same structure — annual limit applies, no per-condition time cap stated | Same | Same |
| **⚠️ Cancer pre-authorisation penalty** | Not documented | ⚠️ **§6.53: Cancer treatment requires pre-authorisation. If not obtained: only 80% paid.** In a fast-developing oncology situation, this is an operational risk. | Genki: 50% if €2,000+ cost estimate not submitted 5 days prior (waived if MCI Assist manages hospitalization) | Pre-authorisation required; emergencies waived |
| **⚠️ Claims filing deadline** | Not stated | ⚠️ **§7: Claims must be submitted within 6 months of treatment date. After that, claim is not paid — no exceptions stated.** | Not stated | Not stated |

# What Extra Money Buys

## SafetyWing ($161/mo) — Eliminated

SafetyWing covers cancer treatment at 100% under its own benefit line. However, all other outpatient costs — including specialist visits, medications, and chronic illness treatment — are subject to a $5,000/year hard cap. One month of biologics for RA, MS, or Crohn's can cost $3,000–$8,000. SafetyWing is eliminated because it cannot protect against catastrophic non-cancer outpatient costs.

---

## Barmenia Plus (~$200/mo) vs Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) — +$117/month

| Benefit | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Impact |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ⚠️ Q15 open | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Significant if Q15 comes back negative for Barmenia. |
| **Renewability certainty** | Explicitly indefinite (contract) | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** | Expacare is more explicit and individual-contract-based. |
| **Israel home country** | 180 days/year | ⚠️ >6 months outside required — hard restriction | If you spend significant time in Israel, Expacare may not be appropriate at all. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | Not documented | ✅ Healix direct settlement | High in practice. |
| **Insurer stability** | ⚠️ Newer product; "travel insurance" label | ✅ 40+ years; Lloyd's backed; IPMI | Expacare is more established and better classified. |
| **You are a direct party** | ⚠️ No — group member only | ✅ Yes — individual policy | Expacare gives you direct legal standing. |
| **Product classification** | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | Long-term IPMI | Expacare is better structured for long-term serious illness. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $10,000,000 | Barmenia is strictly better here for multi-decade catastrophic scenarios. |

**Verdict on +$117/month for Expacare over Barmenia:** Justified if: (a) Q15 is not confirmed in writing for Barmenia, (b) you want an individual policy with direct legal standing, (c) you want 40+ year Lloyd's-backed stability. Major caveat: if you plan to spend significant time in Israel, **Expacare may be incompatible** — the >6 months outside rule is a hard product eligibility requirement, not a coverage limitation.

---

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Genki Premium ($346/mo) — +$29/month for Genki

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Israel home country** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | **Unlimited** | **High if you plan significant Israel stays.** This alone may eliminate Expacare for Noam. |
| **Germany home country** | ⚠️ Same >6 months restriction (German passport = home country) | **Unlimited** | Same concern as Israel. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | "Will not cancel because of age or health record" — explicit, individual contract | "Does not end with a certain age" — explicit, but group contract | Both strong. Expacare's is on an individual policy, which is stronger. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | **No Limit** | Genki is better — no ceiling at all. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Generic rule (minimal risk for modern drugs) | Both acceptable; Expacare has a small ATMP caveat. |
| **Claims handler** | **Expacare directly** (no DR-WALTER) | DR-WALTER (documented multi-month delay) | Expacare is clearly better on claims reliability. |
| **Insurer stability** | 40+ years; Lloyd's | ⚠️ Changed insurers twice; Squarelife since 2021 | Expacare is more stable. |
| **You are a direct party** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ No — group member | Expacare is better. |
| **Product classification** | Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Tied — both correctly classified. |

**Verdict:** For just $29/month more, Genki Premium buys unlimited Israel and Germany coverage and no policy maximum. If you intend to spend substantial time in Israel or Germany, Genki Premium is the correct choice over Expacare. If you're confident you'll stay under 6 months/year in both passport countries, Expacare may be preferable on claims reliability, insurer stability, and individual contract structure.

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond (~$363/mo) — +$46/month for Diamond

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Israel coverage** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | Not documented; Paraguay workaround used | Both uncertain/restricted; neither is clean. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** — explicit | Not stated ⚠️ | Expacare is clearly better on this. |
| **Insurer backing** | **Lloyd's of London** | AXA (reinsurer) | Both strong; different flavors. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | $8,000,000 | Expacare is slightly better. |
| **USA planned treatment** | Emergency only, 6 weeks | **In Full, 45 days including planned treatment** | Diamond better if US access is important. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Full under cancer module | ✅ Confirmed full — no ambiguity | Tied. |
| **Claims track record** | No documented problems; Hans 10+ years | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines (18+ years) | Diamond slightly better documented. |
| **Emergency assistance** | Healix (British Foreign Services) | AXA (very large global network) | Both excellent. |
| **Product age** | 40+ years | Stable since ~2017 | Expacare is longer established. |

**Verdict:** At $46/month more, Diamond buys better USA planned treatment coverage and slightly better documented claims reliability. Expacare wins on explicit renewability guarantee and marginally higher policy max. At this price gap, the decision hinges on whether US access matters and how much weight you place on the explicit no-cancel guarantee.

## Genki Premium ($346/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond ($363/mo) — +$17/month

Only $17/month difference. Diamond buys over Genki Premium:

| Benefit | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Oncology specialty drugs** | Covered; generic rule applies (minimal risk for modern drugs) | **Confirmed in full, no generic rule, zero ambiguity** | If you want absolute certainty on cancer drug coverage, Diamond closes this entirely. |
| **USA coverage** | 28-day emergency only (life-threatening) | **In Full, up to 45 days, including planned treatment** | High if you plan to see US specialists or travel to the US for treatment. |
| **AXA emergency network** | MCI Assist (strong; direct hospital payment) | AXA (very large global network; direct hospital payment) | Marginal difference in practice for LatAm. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $8,000,000 | Genki Premium is strictly better here — No Limit vs $8M cap. |
| **Israel coverage** | Unlimited | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki Premium is strictly better. |
| **Regulatory** | Liechtenstein FMA | UK FCA / Labuan FSA | Both weaker than Barmenia's BaFin. |
| **Renewability** | Explicitly indefinite | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki is more certain. |

**Verdict on +$17/month:** For just $17/month more, Diamond buys complete oncology drug certainty (no generic rule) and full USA planned treatment coverage. Genki Premium wins on policy max and Israel coverage. At this price gap, Diamond makes sense if US access or drug certainty is important to you.

## Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers — Eliminated

| Tier | Monthly | Problem |
|------|---------|---------|
| Emerald | ~$154 | $500 total outpatient budget. Worthless for serious chronic illness. |
| Sapphire | ~$170 | Zero outpatient (except diagnostics). Worse than Emerald for outpatient. |
| Ruby | ~$264 | $3,500 total outpatient. One month of expensive biologics wipes it out. |
| Jade | ~$331 | $10,000 total outpatient. Better, but one year of RA/MS biologics ($15k–$80k) still exceeds it. |

All four tiers are eliminated. Cancer is covered In Full on all Optimum Global tiers including Emerald. The problem is everything else outpatient — all non-cancer chronic illness, specialist visits, and medications are capped, and the caps are too low for serious illness.

## Barmenia Best (€245/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) — +€60/month

For your concerns (catastrophic illness, cancer): **identical**. Best adds no additional protection for serious illness whatsoever.

What the €60/month (€720/year) buys:
- Preventive checkups and vaccinations (cheap in LatAm; €100–300 value/year)
- 2× dental cleanings/year (€30–120 value depending on country)
- 50% dental prosthetics — meaningful if you need a crown or bridge (€300–750 saved per tooth)
- Full outpatient psychotherapy vs 3 sessions — meaningful if you need ongoing mental health support
- Outpatient rehabilitation — meaningful if you need physio after injury/surgery (could be €2,000–5,000 in a bad year)

**Verdict:** Start with Plus. The €720/year extra only pays off in specific events (dental reconstruction, injury rehab, ongoing therapy). If none of those apply in a given year, you've overpaid by €720 for benefits you could cover out of pocket cheaply in LatAm.

## Final Shortlist

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Monthly | ~$200 | **~$317** | $346 | ~$363 |
| Cancer treatment | ✅ (⚠️ Q15 for specialty drugs) | ✅ (full refund; ATMPs $500k lifetime cap ⚠️) | ✅ (generic rule; low risk) | ✅ confirmed |
| Non-cancer catastrophic outpatient | ✅ No Limit (⚠️ Q15) | ✅ Full Refund (Advanced) | ✅ No Limit | ✅ In Full |
| Policy maximum | No Limit | $10,000,000 | No Limit | $8M |
| Israel stays | 180 days/yr | ⚠️ **>6 months outside required — hard eligibility rule** | **Unlimited** | ⚠️ unclear |
| Germany stays | ⚠️ unclear | ⚠️ **Same >6 months outside rule (German passport = home country)** | **Unlimited** | ⚠️ not addressed |
| Direct hospital payment | ⚠️ unclear | ✅ Healix direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist | ✅ AXA |
| Renewability certainty | ✅ explicit | **✅ most explicit: "will not cancel because of age or health record"** | ✅ explicit | ⚠️ not stated |
| Oncology drug certainty | ⚠️ Q15 open | ✅ cancer module; ATMPs capped | Low risk (generic rule) | ✅ confirmed |
| Regulatory protection | **BaFin (best)** | **UK FCA** | Liechtenstein | UK/Labuan |
| You are a direct party | ⚠️ No — group member only | **✅ Yes — individual policy** | ⚠️ No — group member only | ✅ Yes — individual policy |
| Product classification | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | ✅ Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Long-term international health |
| Insurer / product stability | ⚠️ New product, small broker | **✅ 40+ years; Lloyd's** | ⚠️ Insurer changed twice (Barmenia→Allianz→Squarelife) | ✅ Stable since ~2017; AXA-backed |
| Claims track record | No data | ✅ 10+ years with Hans; no documented issues | ⚠️ Documented multi-month delay (Sep 2025); same DR-WALTER handler as Barmenia | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines |

**The decision tree:**

1. **Israel and Germany time test:**
   - If you expect to spend substantial time in Israel (or Germany) — more than 6 months/year in either — **Expacare is eliminated** (hard eligibility requirement, not just a coverage limitation).
   - If you will reliably stay under 6 months/year in both Israel and Germany, Expacare is viable and its individual contract / 40-year stability / explicit renewability guarantee are significant advantages.

2. **Get Q15 answered by Christoph in writing** (for Barmenia Plus):
   - If **yes** (Barmenia covers oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus at $200/mo is the clear value winner on price. But weigh the risk factors below.
   - If **no** (Barmenia does not cover oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus is eliminated for cancer risk. Choose from Expacare, Genki Premium, or Diamond.

3. **New risk factors to weigh for Barmenia Plus / COVRD.EE — from Hans's answers:**
   - **"Travel insurance" classification**: COVRD.EE's own documents call it an *"international travel group health insurance policy."* This may mean travel-style rules (definitions, exclusions, pre-existing condition handling) rather than long-term health insurance rules. This is not yet confirmed to be a real limitation — but it is an unresolved flag worth probing with Christoph.
   - **You are not a direct party to the contract**: The T&Cs are explicit that all rights/obligations exist between DR-WALTER and Barmenia only. In a dispute, you are dependent on DR-WALTER's willingness to act on your behalf — you have no direct legal standing against Barmenia.
   - **DR-WALTER claims concentration risk**: DR-WALTER handles claims for both COVRD.EE and Genki. A documented Genki claim (September 2025) went unresolved for months and required escalation to DR-WALTER's MD. Both products share the same operational bottleneck.
   - **Product youth**: COVRD.EE from a small Estonian broker (Herrmann, Huebner & Partner) is a newer distribution arrangement. Less tested at scale.

4. **Expacare Choices as a middle path** (if Israel/Germany time is not a concern):
   - At ~$317/month, it sits between Barmenia and Genki/Diamond.
   - It gives you: the only explicit written guarantee against cancellation for age or health; a 40-year established insurer backed by Lloyd's; an individual policy (not a group membership); Healix emergency assistance; and a clean claims handler with no documented problems.
   - Trade-offs vs Genki: home country restrictions (Israel/Germany); $10M cap vs no limit; $500k ATMP lifetime cap for gene/cell therapies.
   - Trade-offs vs Diamond: no USA planned treatment; slightly more expensive when deductible is the same ($363 nil excess Diamond vs ~$373 nil excess Expacare).

5. **If you rule out Expacare (home country restriction) and Q15 is confirmed for Barmenia:**
   - Barmenia Plus at $200/mo is the clear value winner on price. Ask yourself: is the $163/mo saving worth the "travel insurance" label risk, the group contract structure, and the shared DR-WALTER claims bottleneck? Over a year that is ~$1,950 in savings. Over five years, ~$9,750.
   - If you value certainty and claims quality above cost, Genki Premium ($346) or Diamond ($363) are the cleaner choices — with Genki Premium winning on Israel coverage and policy max, Diamond winning on cancer drug certainty and USA access.
