# International Health Insurance Comparison

**Profile:** Noam Salomonski, age 35, no fixed residence, Latin America base, Israeli + German dual citizenship. Priority: outpatient coverage against catastrophic costs (cancer, serious illness, specialty drugs). Deductible is acceptable.

**Scope:** Only plans with meaningful outpatient coverage are included.
- Optimum Global Emerald/Sapphire/Ruby/Jade are excluded — outpatient caps of $500–$10,000 are insufficient for serious illness.
- **Only Optimum Global Diamond** is carried forward (full outpatient, In Full, $8M cap).

**Plans compared (age 35, WW excl. USA, ~€/$1,000 deductible unless noted):**

| **Outpatient annual cap** | **In Full** (no cap, within $8M policy max) | **No Limit** | **No Limit** | No specific limit (within €1M annual max) | **No Limit** | **$5,000/year hard cap** (see exceptions below) |
| **Physician & specialist visits** | In Full | 100% | 100% | Covered | Covered | 100% UCR (within $5k cap) |
| **Prescribed medications (general)** | In Full | 100% | 100% | Covered (generic equivalent rule) | Covered (generic equivalent rule) | 100% UCR (within $5k cap) |
| **Lab / imaging (CT, MRI, PET)** | In Full | 100% | 100% | Covered | Covered | 100% UCR (within $5k cap) |

**Answer to your question:** You are fully covered for outpatient catastrophe on Optimum Global Diamond, Barmenia (Plus or Best), and Genki Premium. SafetyWing caps general outpatient at $5,000/year — but importantly, cancer/oncology is a separate carve-out (see below).

## Section G — Priority-Ordered Summary

*Ordered by what you care about most, from most critical to least.*

---

### 1. Full outpatient coverage — protection against catastrophic outpatient costs

**The question:** If you're treated for cancer, a chronic illness, or another expensive ongoing condition purely as an outpatient (drugs, infusions, specialist visits), are you covered without hitting a cap that could bankrupt you?

| Plan | Outpatient for serious illness | Verdict |
|------|-------------------------------|---------|
| **Optimum Global Diamond** | **In Full** — no cap (within $8M policy max). Cancer explicitly "In Full" separately. | ✅ Best-in-class |
| **Barmenia Plus / Best** | **No Limit** — cancer covered as standard illness at 100%. ⚠️ Specialty drug question still open. | ✅ (pending Q15) |
| **Genki Premium** | No specific outpatient cap (within "No Limit" policy). Cancer explicitly covered. Generic drug rule may limit brand-name specialty meds. | ✅ (with brand-name drug caveat) |
| **Genki Basic** | No specific outpatient cap, but **€1M annual max** total. Cancer covered. Generic rule applies. | ✅ with total cap risk |
| **SafetyWing** | General outpatient hard-capped at **$5,000/year**. **BUT**: oncology (cancer tests, medication, chemo, radio) is explicitly carved out at 100% UCR inpatient or outpatient, **outside the $5k cap**. Dialysis also carved out. Regular chronic illness meds: inside $5k cap. | ⚠️ Cancer: OK. Chronic non-cancer outpatient: inadequate. |

**Conclusion:** If your concern is cancer specifically, all five plans cover you — even SafetyWing, where oncology is a separate 100% benefit. If your concern is expensive chronic medication (diabetes biologics, autoimmune infusions, etc.) that isn't cancer, SafetyWing fails badly at $5k/year. Barmenia and Genki Premium are best for this.

---

### 2. Cancer — the catastrophic scenario

| Plan | Cancer coverage | Oncology drugs (specialty, biologics, immunotherapy) |
|------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Optimum Global Diamond** | In Full (explicit TOB line: "Cancer treatment in-patient & out-patient: In Full") | Covered under cancer line — explicitly outside outpatient budget |
| **Barmenia** | 100% as standard illness, no limit | ⚠️ **Q15 unanswered** — must get written confirmation from Christoph |
| **Genki Premium** | Explicitly named ("Cancer Treatment — chemotherapy, radiotherapy, related treatments") | Covered if prescribed; **generic equivalent rule** — insurer may only cover cost of generic even if no generic exists in your country |
| **SafetyWing** | 100% UCR "Oncology: cancer tests, medication and treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy)" — both inpatient and outpatient, outside $5k cap | Same line — explicitly covered at 100% |

**What extra money buys:** Optimum Global Diamond (~$363/mo) vs SafetyWing ($161/mo): for cancer specifically, SafetyWing matches Diamond on oncology. The difference appears in everything else (outpatient non-cancer, general medicine, policy max). The $202/month premium gap primarily buys: higher overall policy max ($1.5M vs $8M), full non-cancer outpatient, and better chronic illness coverage.

---

### 3. Annual policy maximum — does a cap put you at risk?

| Plan | Max | Risk scenario |
|------|-----|---------------|
| Optimum Global Diamond | $8,000,000 | Virtually no realistic scenario exceeds this |
| Barmenia Plus / Best | **No Limit** | Zero tail risk |
| Genki Premium | **No Limit** | Zero tail risk |
| Genki Basic | €1,000,000 | A multi-year cancer treatment in a Western country could approach this |
| SafetyWing | $1,500,000 | Adequate for most scenarios; extreme long-term illness is a risk |

**What extra money buys:** Barmenia Best (€245/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) = €60/mo for no-limit vs no-limit — same cap. The extra €60 buys preventive care, vaccinations, dental cleanings, full outpatient psychotherapy, vision aids, and extended prenatal care. It does NOT buy more inpatient/outpatient limit.

---

### 4. Home country (Israel) visits

| Plan | Israel coverage | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Genki Premium** | **Full Country Coverage** — unlimited days, no restriction | Best for frequent Israel stays |
| SafetyWing | Marketed as "full coverage in home country" (need to verify; travel portion excludes primary residence) ⚠️ | Verify with SafetyWing |
| **Barmenia** | 180 days/year ⚠️ | Germany dual citizenship may further split this (Q17 open) |
| **Genki Basic** | 182-day max per visit; must be 91 days outside Israel before each stay | Restrictive for extended stays |
| Optimum Global Diamond | Paraguay address workaround; Israel coverage unclear ⚠️ | |

**What extra money buys:** Genki Basic → Genki Premium upgrades Israel coverage from 182-day cap (with 91-day gap) to **full unlimited coverage**. This is a significant difference if you plan multi-month Israel stays.

---

### 5. What each extra dollar buys you

| Comparison | Extra cost | What you get |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| SafetyWing ($161) → Barmenia Plus (~€185) | ~+€25/mo (+15%) | Non-cancer outpatient unlimited instead of $5k; no-limit policy max vs $1.5M; German regulatory protection; Air Doctor integration |
| Barmenia Plus (€185) → Barmenia Best (€245) | +€60/mo (+32%) | Preventive care, all vaccinations, dental cleanings (2x/yr), 50% dentures, full outpatient psychotherapy, vision aids €300/2yr, extended prenatal |
| SafetyWing ($161) → Optimum Global Diamond (~$363) | +$202/mo (+125%) | Unlimited non-cancer outpatient; $8M policy max; full outpatient In Full; better chronic illness meds without $5k cap; full USA coverage (45 days/trip); better home nursing; AXA emergency guarantees |
| Barmenia Best (€245) → Optimum Global Diamond (~$363) | +~$120/mo (+~47%) | USA coverage 45 days vs 6 weeks emergency; AXA direct guarantee; named inpatient benefits; explicitly confirmed specialty drug coverage (Q15 closes this gap for Barmenia if answered yes) |
| Any plan → Genki Premium | Unknown premium | Full Country Coverage for Israel/Germany; no age limit; monthly cancellation; MCI Assist direct hospital payment; broader chronic illness explicit coverage |

---

### 6. Open questions that must be resolved before signing

| Question | Affects |
|----------|---------|
| ⚠️ **Barmenia Q15**: Does "Medication 100%" explicitly cover oncology biologics, immunotherapy, targeted oral meds? | If yes → Barmenia equals or beats Optimum Global Diamond for cancer at lower cost. If no → major gap. |
| ⚠️ **Barmenia Q17**: Does German dual citizenship trigger 180-day limit in Germany as well as Israel? | Affects Israel visit freedom |
| ⚠️ **Genki Native premium price** | Cannot cost-compare without this |
| ⚠️ **SafetyWing home country**: Does the health portion (VUMI) cover Israel stays fully, or does the "primary residence excluded" rule apply? | If primary residence is excluded in health portion too, home country coverage is zero |
| ⚠️ **Optimum Global Diamond**: What is the minimum contract period? | Flexibility to switch |
