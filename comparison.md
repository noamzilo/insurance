# International Health Insurance Comparison

**Profile:** Noam Salomonski, age 35, male, no fixed residence, Latin America base, Israeli + German dual citizenship. No plans for children. Priority: full outpatient coverage for cancer and non-cancer catastrophic illness (expensive chronic conditions, biologics, serious illness). Deductible acceptable.

---

## Plans Under Consideration

SafetyWing is **eliminated**: the $5,000/year hard cap on general outpatient means a serious non-cancer chronic condition (RA, MS, Crohn's, autoimmune disease requiring biologics) is effectively uncovered. Cancer itself has a separate benefit line, but everything else outpatient is capped at $5,000 — which one month of biologics can exhaust.

**The four relevant plans:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual max | Outpatient |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Barmenia Plus** (NOMADS.insure) | ~$200 (€185) | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Expacare Choices** (BrokerFish) | **~$317** ($850 deductible + lifestyle discount) | $10,000,000 | **Full Refund** |
| **Genki Native Premium** | **$346** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Optimum Global Diamond** (BrokerFish) | ~$363 | $8,000,000 | **In Full** |

Barmenia Best (€245/mo) adds nothing relevant for catastrophic illness — see end of document.
Genki Basic ($248/mo) has a €1,000,000 annual cap — inadequate if a serious illness runs multi-year.
Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers have outpatient caps that cannot handle expensive chronic illness — see end of document.
Expacare Choices = Core + Option 1 Cancer/Chronic Full + Option 2 Advanced Outpatient + Option 3 Dental/Wellness/Optical; Area 2 (worldwide excl. USA/Caribbean); $850 deductible; with lifestyle discount.

## Renewability, Continuity & Premium Protection

**Note from Hans (Q16):** Even large companies like Allianz Care and Bupa have launched new products and migrated healthy customers to them, leaving sick customers on legacy "closed" plans where no new healthy lives join — causing claim ratios to worsen and premiums to spiral. This structural risk exists regardless of whether a contract says "guaranteed renewal." Hans has seen this with Allianz, Bupa, IMG, and a few others. He considers it an exception rather than the rule but notes there are never absolute lifetime guarantees.

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Renewability** | "This contract is not limited in time" — renews indefinitely | **"We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record"** — explicit | "Does not end with a certain age or after a certain period" — renews indefinitely. Insurer can only cancel for fraud/obligations violation, or full product discontinuation for all customers. | ⚠️ **Either party can terminate at any renewal with 30 days notice** (Membership Guide §8). No restriction on reason. |
| **Age limit to join** | None stated | **Under 65** (individual policy) | None — explicitly documented | None stated |
| **What happens at age 65** | Nothing — policy continues | Can no longer join new policy; but existing policy explicitly continues — "will not cancel because of age" | Nothing — policy explicitly continues regardless of age | Unknown — no contractual protection |
| **Premium increases with age** | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice required | Yes — age brackets published | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice; can cancel if increase is age-triggered | Yes — 30 days advance notice (§7a) |

### Contractual Continuity & Premium Protection

**This is the single most important section for long-term catastrophic coverage.** Full policy wording review (not just TOB/brochures) reveals three fundamentally different contractual positions on whether an insurer can single you out after you become expensive:

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Can they single you out on premium?** | Not documented in available T&Cs | ⚠️ **YES** — "Insurers reserve the right to amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" (Membership Guide §2.3) | **NO** — premiums adjusted "for all customers" (Insurance Conditions §5.5). Age brackets only (§5.4). | ⚠️ **YES** — "We may vary the benefits, cover and/or premium" at renewal (Membership Guide §7a), no restriction on individual vs. pool |
| **Can they refuse to renew you?** | Not documented | **NO for age/health** — "We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record" (§2.4). But can discontinue the plan entirely. | **NO** — only for fraud/obligations violation, or full product discontinuation for everyone (§5.3). Cannot cancel because you received benefits. | ⚠️ **YES** — either party can terminate at any renewal date with 30 days notice (§8). No restriction on reason. |
| **Can they change your terms individually?** | Not documented | ⚠️ **YES** — same §2.3 clause covers terms as well as premiums | **NO** — contract changes apply to everyone at yearly renewal. You can exit if you don't accept. | ⚠️ **YES** — §7a allows varying "benefits, cover and/or premium"; §4 allows changing terms or declining cover entirely for "material changes" in circumstances |
| **Premium rating model** | Not documented | No community rating language. No age brackets, group rating, or pool-wide-only mechanism documented. | **Explicit pool-wide rating.** "Every year, the Insurer compares the expected insurance costs against the actual costs for all customers. If needed, the Insurer adjusts the prices for all customers." | No community rating language. No age brackets or group rating documented. |
| **Governing insurance law** | German VVG (strong consumer protection) | UK (FCA-regulated, but no community rating mandate for IPMI) | **German VVG applies** (via Liechtenstein EEA passport + German operations). VVG provides significant statutory consumer protections for health insurance. | Guernsey law (lighter regulation) |

**The Expacare contradiction:** Expacare promises "We will not cancel your plan because of your age or health record" — but in the same document reserves "the right to amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases." They cannot kick you out, but they can raise YOUR premium specifically, potentially pricing you out. The no-cancellation promise protects against outright termination but not against unaffordable individual premium increases.

**The OG gap:** OG's policy (§7a + §8) gives them unrestricted power to both vary your individual premium AND terminate your policy at any renewal for any reason with 30 days notice. There is no "will not cancel" clause. Hans's assurance that "Optimum Global or Expacare would not increase your premium or cancel your plan due to claims" is professional experience — the contract explicitly permits both.

**The Genki protection:** Genki is the only insurer whose contract commits to pool-wide-only premium adjustment ("for all customers"). Combined with the cancellation protections (only for fraud or full product discontinuation), this is the strongest contractual continuity position. The trade-off: Genki is a group policy (you're not a direct contracting party) and their insurer has changed twice.

## 1. Provider Identity

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Your contract is with** | **Nobody directly.** DR-WALTER GmbH is the policyholder and holds the group contract with Barmenia. T&Cs state: *"rights and obligations arising from this contract exist exclusively between the policyholder and the insurer."* You join as an insured member under DR-WALTER's group policy, not as a direct contracting party. | **Expacare Limited** (UK) — direct individual policy. You are the policyholder. | **Nobody directly.** Genki is the policyholder and holds the group contract with Squarelife. Same structure as Barmenia — you are an insured member under Genki's group policy. | **Optimum Global Limited** (UK) — you are a direct individual policyholder. Risk is carried by **Optimum Global Insurance Company Limited** (Guernsey). Two distinct OG entities; UK entity is your counterparty, Guernsey entity carries the risk. |
| **Who actually pays claims** | **Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG** (Germany), administered by DR-WALTER GmbH | **Expacare** directly (their own in-house claims team); **Healix** for emergency assistance | **Squarelife Insurance AG** (Liechtenstein), administered by Genki | **Optimum Global** (UK / Guernsey) |
| **Insurer** | **Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG** (Germany, BaFin regulated) | **Lloyd's of London** syndicates | Squarelife (Liechtenstein) | Optimum Global Insurance Co. Ltd (Guernsey) |
| **Backing** | Medicator AG (German insolvency protection fund) | **Lloyd's of London** (world's leading specialist insurance market) | — | **AXA** (reinsurer + emergency payment guarantees) |
| **Broker / platform** | NOMADS.insure (Herrmann, Huebner & Partner; Estonian broker) / DR-WALTER GmbH (German policyholder & claims handler) | **BrokerFish (Hans Benn; Labuan FSA licensed)** | Genki GmbH (German startup; policyholder, agent & claims handler for Squarelife) | BrokerFish (Hans Benn; Labuan FSA licensed) |
| **Claims handler** | **DR-WALTER GmbH** (same company handles claims for both COVRD.EE and Genki — single point of failure for two of the four products) | **Expacare directly** (their own team) | **DR-WALTER GmbH** (same as above — see claims section) | **Optimum Global** directly |
| **Emergency assistance** | Not specified ⚠️ | **Healix** (24/7; direct hospital settlement; same provider used by British Foreign Services for all overseas staff) | **MCI Assist** (24/7; pays hospital directly, no bill to you) | **AXA** (24/7; issues direct payment guarantee to hospital) |
| **Regulatory protection** | **BaFin (strongest in EU)** + free PKV Ombudsman for disputes | **UK FCA** (Expacare Limited authorised and regulated by FCA) | Liechtenstein FMA (EEA-passported) | UK FCA / Labuan FSA (broker) |
| **Jurisdiction** | **German law** | UK | Liechtenstein / German VVG applies | UK |
| **Product classification** | ⚠️ **"International travel group health insurance"** — the document's own label. Travel-style classification may mean travel-style rules: different exclusion sets, stricter pre-existing condition treatment, and claims processes designed for trips rather than long-term illness. | **International Private Medical Insurance (IPMI)** — explicitly positioned as long-term expat health. Expacare branding: "we're in it for the long term." | Long-term expat / remote worker health insurance — explicitly positioned as permanent coverage | Long-term international health insurance — established product with stable insurer since ~2017 |
| **Insurer / product stability** | ⚠️ COVRD.EE is a relatively new product from a small Estonian broker. Barmenia is a large, established insurer, but the distribution arrangement is young. | **40+ years established; Lloyd's-backed.** Hans has worked with Expacare for 10+ years. | ⚠️ Genki has already changed insurers twice: Barmenia → Allianz → Squarelife (current). Product has been restructured. | **Optimum Global has been operating since the 1990s; moved to self-insure (with AXA reinsurance) around 2017. Stable structure.** |

## 2. Outpatient — The Critical Section

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Annual outpatient cap** | **No Limit** | **Full Refund** (no cap, within $10M policy max) | **No Limit** | **In Full** (no cap, within $8M policy max) |
| **GP / specialist visits** | 100% | Full refund | Covered | In Full |
| **Prescribed medications (general)** | 100% | Full refund (Advanced level). ⚠️ Note: cancer and chronic meds are handled under their own module, not this line — see Section 3. | Covered — generic equivalent rule applies¹ | In Full |
| **Lab / imaging (CT, MRI, PET)** | 100% | Full refund (CT/MRI/PET explicitly listed in Core) | Covered | In Full |
| **Emergency room (outpatient)** | Covered | Full refund | Covered | In Full |
| **Chronic condition meds (outpatient)** | 100%, no cap ⚠️ see Q15 below | ✅ Covered under Cancer/Chronic Full Cover module — outpatient chronic prescriptions follow the outpatient benefit level = full refund with Advanced ⚠️ see note below² | Covered, no sub-cap — generic rule¹ | **In Full, confirmed, no ambiguity** |
| **Free choice of doctors** | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes ("no restrictions on the doctor or medical facility that you want to attend") | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes |

¹ *Generic equivalent rule (Genki):* Genki reimburses medication up to the cost of the cheapest available generic. If a generic exists for a drug, you cover the brand-name premium out of pocket. If no generic exists — which is the case for most modern targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and biologics — the rule does not apply and the full cost is covered.

² *Expacare chronic condition prescriptions:* The standard outpatient prescription benefit explicitly "excludes medication for cancer, maternity and psychiatric conditions." However, outpatient prescriptions for chronic conditions are covered under the Cancer & Chronic Full Cover module, which states outpatient treatment and prescriptions for chronic conditions are "subject to the out-patient benefit limits of the out-patient option selected." With Advanced Outpatient selected, this = full refund. Cancer medications are covered under the cancer treatment line (full refund), not the prescription drug line.

Expatriate = living outside home country >6 months/year. You must spend >6 months/year outside Israel. No workaround.** | **Full Country Coverage — unlimited days, no restriction** | Not explicitly documented ⚠️ (Paraguay address used as workaround) |
| **Germany (dual citizenship)** | ⚠️ Q17 unanswered: does Germany also trigger 180-day limit, splitting allowance between two countries? | ⚠️ **Germany is also a home country (you hold a German passport).

## 10. Open Questions Before Signing

| Question | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **⚠️ Q15 — Oncology specialty drugs** | Must get written confirmation: does "Medication 100%" cover biologics, immunotherapy, targeted oral cancer drugs? This is the single blocking question. If yes → equivalent to Expacare/Diamond. If no → serious cancer drug gap. | ✅ Cancer treatment (full refund, outpatient) covers cancer drugs. ATMPs ($500k lifetime cap) for gene/cell therapies. Standard biologics/immunotherapy covered under cancer treatment line — **no separate cap.** ⚠️ **§6.20 risk**: "experimental treatment" is excluded using the UK as a guide — a cutting-edge drug not yet standard in UK practice could be refused. | Generic rule: no issue for modern drugs with no generic (most cancer drugs). Potential out-of-pocket cost only for drugs where a generic exists. | ✅ Confirmed in full — explicit TOB line, no ambiguity. |
| **⚠️ Israel/Germany home country** | Does German citizenship trigger a second 180-day limit, splitting the allowance? | ⚠️ **Hard restriction for both countries.** Must confirm with Hans: does the >6-months rule apply to each passport country separately, or cumulatively? If cumulative, Israel + Germany together must be < 6 months/year total. | ✅ Both Israel and Germany get unlimited Full Country Coverage. No issue. | ⚠️ Not addressed. Paraguay address workaround confirmed by Hans. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | ⚠️ Not documented — likely reimbursement | ✅ Healix/Expacare direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist pays hospital directly | ✅ AXA payment guarantee |
| **Minimum contract / exit** | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ✅ Annual; pro-rated refund if no claims | ✅ 12 months then monthly | ✅ Now documented: annual, either party can terminate at renewal with 30 days notice (§8). |
| **Renewability at older age** | ✅ No cutoff stated | ✅ **Explicit: "will not cancel because of age or health record"** | ✅ Explicitly no cutoff | ⚠️ **No protection.** Policy auto-renews if plan still available (§7a), but OG can terminate at any renewal (§8) or vary premium/terms without restriction. |
| **⚠️ Individual premium singling** | Not documented | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" (§2.3) | ✅ **Contract prohibits it** — adjustments are "for all customers" only (§5.5) | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "may vary benefits, cover and/or premium" at renewal (§7a), no pool-wide restriction |
| **Ongoing illness duration** | No time cap confirmed by Hans (Q18): treatment covered up to annual limit, each year it renews, as long as policy is active | Same structure — annual limit applies, no per-condition time cap stated | Same | Same |
| **⚠️ Cancer pre-authorisation penalty** | Not documented | ⚠️ **§6.53: Cancer treatment requires pre-authorisation. If not obtained: only 80% paid.** In a fast-developing oncology situation, this is an operational risk. | Genki: 50% if €2,000+ cost estimate not submitted 5 days prior (waived if MCI Assist manages hospitalization) | Pre-authorisation required; emergencies waived |
| **⚠️ Claims filing deadline** | Not stated | ⚠️ **§7: Claims must be submitted within 6 months of treatment date. After that, claim is not paid — no exceptions stated.** | Not stated | Not stated |

# What Extra Money Buys

## SafetyWing ($161/mo) — Eliminated

SafetyWing covers cancer treatment at 100% under its own benefit line. However, all other outpatient costs — including specialist visits, medications, and chronic illness treatment — are subject to a $5,000/year hard cap. One month of biologics for RA, MS, or Crohn's can cost $3,000–$8,000. SafetyWing is eliminated because it cannot protect against catastrophic non-cancer outpatient costs.

---

## Barmenia Plus (~$200/mo) vs Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) — +$117/month

| Benefit | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Impact |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ⚠️ Q15 open | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Significant if Q15 comes back negative for Barmenia. |
| **Renewability certainty** | Explicitly indefinite (contract) | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** | Expacare is more explicit and individual-contract-based. |
| **Israel home country** | 180 days/year | ⚠️ >6 months outside required — hard restriction | If you spend significant time in Israel, Expacare may not be appropriate at all. |
| **Direct hospital payment** | Not documented | ✅ Healix direct settlement | High in practice. |
| **Insurer stability** | ⚠️ Newer product; "travel insurance" label | ✅ 40+ years; Lloyd's backed; IPMI | Expacare is more established and better classified. |
| **You are a direct party** | ⚠️ No — group member only | ✅ Yes — individual policy | Expacare gives you direct legal standing. |
| **Product classification** | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | Long-term IPMI | Expacare is better structured for long-term serious illness. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $10,000,000 | Barmenia is strictly better here for multi-decade catastrophic scenarios. |

**Verdict on +$117/month for Expacare over Barmenia:** Justified if: (a) Q15 is not confirmed in writing for Barmenia, (b) you want an individual policy with direct legal standing, (c) you want 40+ year Lloyd's-backed stability. Major caveat: if you plan to spend significant time in Israel, **Expacare may be incompatible** — the >6 months outside rule is a hard product eligibility requirement, not a coverage limitation.

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Genki Premium ($346/mo) — +$29/month for Genki

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Israel home country** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | **Unlimited** | **High if you plan significant Israel stays.** This alone may eliminate Expacare for Noam. |
| **Germany home country** | ⚠️ Same >6 months restriction (German passport = home country) | **Unlimited** | Same concern as Israel. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | "Will not cancel because of age or health record" — explicit, individual contract | "Does not end with a certain age" — explicit, but group contract | Both protect against cancellation. Expacare's is on an individual policy. |
| **Individual premium singling** | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" | **✅ Contract prohibits it** — adjustments are "for all customers" only | **Genki is stronger on the pricing-out risk.** Expacare can't cancel you but can individually raise your premium. Genki can do neither. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | **No Limit** | Genki is better — no ceiling at all. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Covered under cancer module; ATMPs $500k cap | Generic rule (minimal risk for modern drugs) | Both acceptable; Expacare has a small ATMP caveat. |
| **Claims handler** | **Expacare directly** (no DR-WALTER) | DR-WALTER (documented multi-month delay) | Expacare is clearly better on claims reliability. |
| **Insurer stability** | 40+ years; Lloyd's | ⚠️ Changed insurers twice; Squarelife since 2021 | Expacare is more stable. |
| **You are a direct party** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ No — group member | Expacare is better. |
| **Product classification** | Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Tied — both correctly classified. |

**Verdict:** For just $29/month more, Genki Premium buys unlimited Israel and Germany coverage, no policy maximum, and — critically — **the only contractual protection against individual premium singling.** Genki's "for all customers" pricing means they cannot raise your premium because you became expensive. Expacare's contract explicitly reserves this right. If long-term continuity after a catastrophic illness is the priority, Genki's contractual protections outweigh Expacare's advantages in insurer stability and claims handling. If you're confident you'll stay under 6 months/year in both passport countries and weigh insurer track record above contractual language, Expacare remains strong.

## Expacare Choices (~$317/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond (~$363/mo) — +$46/month for Diamond

| Benefit | Expacare Choices | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Israel coverage** | ⚠️ >6 months outside required | Not documented; Paraguay workaround used | Both uncertain/restricted; neither is clean. |
| **Renewability guarantee** | **"Will not cancel because of age or health record"** — explicit | ⚠️ **No protection.** Either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice, no restriction (§8). | **Expacare is categorically better.** OG can walk away; Expacare cannot cancel you for health. |
| **Individual premium singling** | ⚠️ Contract permits it (§2.3) | ⚠️ Contract permits it (§7a) | Both can single you out. Neither offers pool-wide pricing protection. |
| **Insurer backing** | **Lloyd's of London** | AXA (reinsurer) | Both strong; different flavors. |
| **Policy maximum** | $10,000,000 | $8,000,000 | Expacare is slightly better. |
| **USA planned treatment** | Emergency only, 6 weeks | **In Full, 45 days including planned treatment** | Diamond better if US access is important. |
| **Cancer drug certainty** | ✅ Full under cancer module | ✅ Confirmed full — no ambiguity | Tied. |
| **Claims track record** | No documented problems; Hans 10+ years | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines (18+ years) | Diamond slightly better documented. |
| **Emergency assistance** | Healix (British Foreign Services) | AXA (very large global network) | Both excellent. |
| **Product age** | 40+ years | Stable since ~2017 | Expacare is longer established. |

**Verdict:** At $46/month more, Diamond buys better USA planned treatment coverage and slightly better documented claims reliability. But Expacare is now clearly superior on continuity: it has an explicit no-cancellation guarantee for age/health (even if it can still individually adjust premiums), while OG has no such protection — either party can terminate at any renewal for any reason. Both can individually adjust premiums. If long-term continuity matters, Expacare is the better choice of these two.

## Genki Premium ($346/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond ($363/mo) — +$17/month

Only $17/month difference. Diamond buys over Genki Premium:

| Benefit | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Oncology specialty drugs** | Covered; generic rule applies (minimal risk for modern drugs) | **Confirmed in full, no generic rule, zero ambiguity** | If you want absolute certainty on cancer drug coverage, Diamond closes this entirely. |
| **USA coverage** | 28-day emergency only (life-threatening) | **In Full, up to 45 days, including planned treatment** | High if you plan to see US specialists or travel to the US for treatment. |
| **AXA emergency network** | MCI Assist (strong; direct hospital payment) | AXA (very large global network; direct hospital payment) | Marginal difference in practice for LatAm. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $8,000,000 | Genki Premium is strictly better here — No Limit vs $8M cap. |
| **Israel coverage** | Unlimited | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki Premium is strictly better. |
| **Regulatory** | Liechtenstein FMA + German VVG | UK FCA / Guernsey | German VVG provides stronger statutory consumer protection for health insurance. |
| **Renewability** | Explicitly indefinite; cannot cancel for claims | ⚠️ **Either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice** (§8) | **Genki is categorically better.** |
| **Individual premium singling** | **✅ Contract prohibits it** — "for all customers" only | ⚠️ **Contract permits it** — no restriction | **Genki is categorically better.** This is the decisive difference for catastrophic long-term coverage. |

**Verdict on +$17/month:** Diamond buys complete oncology drug certainty (no generic rule) and full USA planned treatment coverage. But Genki Premium wins on every long-term protection metric: pool-wide pricing (cannot single you out), cannot cancel for claims, unlimited Israel, no policy max. For someone buying insurance primarily for catastrophic long-term coverage, **Genki's contractual protections are worth more than Diamond's within-year benefit advantages.** Diamond makes sense only if US access is a hard requirement.

## Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers — Eliminated

| Tier | Monthly | Problem |
|------|---------|---------|
| Emerald | ~$154 | $500 total outpatient budget. Worthless for serious chronic illness. |
| Sapphire | ~$170 | Zero outpatient (except diagnostics). Worse than Emerald for outpatient. |
| Ruby | ~$264 | $3,500 total outpatient. One month of expensive biologics wipes it out. |
| Jade | ~$331 | $10,000 total outpatient. Better, but one year of RA/MS biologics ($15k–$80k) still exceeds it. |

All four tiers are eliminated. Cancer is covered In Full on all Optimum Global tiers including Emerald. The problem is everything else outpatient — all non-cancer chronic illness, specialist visits, and medications are capped, and the caps are too low for serious illness.

---

## Barmenia Best (€245/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) — +€60/month

For your concerns (catastrophic illness, cancer): **identical**. Best adds no additional protection for serious illness whatsoever.

What the €60/month (€720/year) buys:
- Preventive checkups and vaccinations (cheap in LatAm; €100–300 value/year)
- 2× dental cleanings/year (€30–120 value depending on country)
- 50% dental prosthetics — meaningful if you need a crown or bridge (€300–750 saved per tooth)
- Full outpatient psychotherapy vs 3 sessions — meaningful if you need ongoing mental health support
- Outpatient rehabilitation — meaningful if you need physio after injury/surgery (could be €2,000–5,000 in a bad year)

**Verdict:** Start with Plus. The €720/year extra only pays off in specific events (dental reconstruction, injury rehab, ongoing therapy). If none of those apply in a given year, you've overpaid by €720 for benefits you could cover out of pocket cheaply in LatAm.

## Final Shortlist

| | Barmenia Plus | Expacare Choices | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Monthly | ~$200 | **~$317** | $346 | ~$363 |
| Cancer treatment | ✅ (⚠️ Q15 for specialty drugs) | ✅ (full refund; ATMPs $500k lifetime cap ⚠️) | ✅ (generic rule; low risk) | ✅ confirmed |
| Non-cancer catastrophic outpatient | ✅ No Limit (⚠️ Q15) | ✅ Full Refund (Advanced) | ✅ No Limit | ✅ In Full |
| Policy maximum | No Limit | $10,000,000 | No Limit | $8M |
| Israel stays | 180 days/yr | ⚠️ **>6 months outside required — hard eligibility rule** | **Unlimited** | ⚠️ unclear |
| Germany stays | ⚠️ unclear | ⚠️ **Same >6 months outside rule (German passport = home country)** | **Unlimited** | ⚠️ not addressed |
| Direct hospital payment | ⚠️ unclear | ✅ Healix direct settlement | ✅ MCI Assist | ✅ AXA |
| Renewability certainty | ✅ explicit | **✅ most explicit: "will not cancel because of age or health record"** | ✅ explicit; cannot cancel for claims | ⚠️ **Weak: either party can terminate at any renewal, 30 days notice, no restriction** |
| Can they single you out on premium? | Not documented | ⚠️ **Yes — contract permits individual adjustment** | **✅ No — pool-wide only ("for all customers")** | ⚠️ **Yes — no restriction on individual vs. pool** |
| Oncology drug certainty | ⚠️ Q15 open | ✅ cancer module; ATMPs capped | Low risk (generic rule) | ✅ confirmed |
| Regulatory protection | **BaFin (best)** | **UK FCA** | Liechtenstein | UK/Labuan |
| You are a direct party | ⚠️ No — group member only | **✅ Yes — individual policy** | ⚠️ No — group member only | ✅ Yes — individual policy |
| Product classification | ⚠️ "Travel group health insurance" | ✅ Long-term IPMI | Long-term expat health | Long-term international health |
| Insurer / product stability | ⚠️ New product, small broker | **✅ 40+ years; Lloyd's** | ⚠️ Insurer changed twice (Barmenia→Allianz→Squarelife) | ✅ Stable since ~2017; AXA-backed |
| Claims track record | No data | ✅ 10+ years with Hans; no documented issues | ⚠️ Documented multi-month delay (Sep 2025); same DR-WALTER handler as Barmenia | ✅ ~2 weeks; very few declines |

**The decision tree:**

1. **Long-term continuity test (most important for catastrophic coverage):**
   - **OG Diamond** has the weakest contractual continuity of all four plans. The policy permits individual premium adjustment, individual terms changes, and outright termination at any renewal with 30 days notice for any reason. If long-term continuity after becoming sick is your top priority, **OG is the riskiest choice contractually** despite Hans's experience that it doesn't happen.
   - **Expacare** cannot cancel you for age or health, but CAN individually adjust your premium and terms — creating a "pricing out" risk. Stronger than OG, but not bulletproof.
   - **Genki Premium** is the only plan that contractually commits to pool-wide-only pricing ("for all customers") and cannot cancel except for fraud or full product discontinuation. Strongest continuity protection. Trade-off: group policy (not a direct party), insurer changed twice.
   - **Barmenia Plus** — continuity protections not documented in available T&Cs.

2. **Israel and Germany time test:**
   - If you expect to spend substantial time in Israel (or Germany) — more than 6 months/year in either — **Expacare is eliminated** (hard eligibility requirement, not just a coverage limitation).
   - If you will reliably stay under 6 months/year in both Israel and Germany, Expacare is viable and its individual contract / 40-year stability / no-cancellation guarantee are significant advantages.
   - OG uses "Home Country" as declared on the application form (not passport-based like Expacare). Hans has confirmed Paraguay address workaround for Israel. This is an informal arrangement, not a contractual right — works until it doesn't.

3. **Get Q15 answered by Christoph in writing** (for Barmenia Plus):
   - If **yes** (Barmenia covers oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus at $200/mo is the clear value winner on price. But weigh the risk factors below.
   - If **no** (Barmenia does not cover oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus is eliminated for cancer risk. Choose from Expacare, Genki Premium, or Diamond.

4. **Risk factors for Barmenia Plus / COVRD.EE:**
   - **"Travel insurance" classification**: COVRD.EE's own documents call it an *"international travel group health insurance policy."* This may mean travel-style rules rather than long-term health insurance rules.
   - **You are not a direct party to the contract**: All rights/obligations exist between DR-WALTER and Barmenia only. No direct legal standing against Barmenia.
   - **DR-WALTER claims concentration risk**: DR-WALTER handles claims for both COVRD.EE and Genki. A documented Genki claim (September 2025) went unresolved for months.
   - **Product youth**: COVRD.EE from a small Estonian broker is a newer distribution arrangement.

5. **Expacare Choices as a middle path** (if Israel/Germany time is not a concern):
   - At ~$317/month, it sits between Barmenia and Genki/Diamond.
   - Strengths: explicit no-cancellation guarantee for age/health; 40-year Lloyd's-backed insurer; individual policy; Healix emergency assistance; clean claims handler.
   - ⚠️ New concern: "amend or alter premiums and terms on individual cases" means they can price you out without formally cancelling you. The no-cancellation clause protects against termination but not against unaffordable individual premium increases.
   - Trade-offs vs Genki: home country restrictions; $10M cap vs no limit; $500k ATMP lifetime cap; no pool-wide pricing protection.
   - Trade-offs vs Diamond: no USA planned treatment; slightly more expensive at nil excess.

6. **If long-term continuity is the deciding factor:**
   - **Genki Premium** ($346/mo) offers the strongest contractual protection: pool-wide pricing, no individual singling, cancellation only for fraud or full product discontinuation, unlimited Israel/Germany, no policy max. Trade-offs: group policy structure, insurer has changed twice, DR-WALTER claims handler (documented problems).
   - **Expacare** ($317/mo) offers the strongest insurer stability (40 years, Lloyd's) and an individual policy with no-cancellation guarantee, but permits individual premium adjustment — a meaningful gap for someone buying insurance specifically for the catastrophic long-term scenario.
   - **OG Diamond** ($363/mo) offers the best within-year benefits (confirmed oncology drugs, USA access, AXA emergency network) but the weakest long-term contractual position of all four plans.
