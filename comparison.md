# What Extra Money Buys — Detailed Stepwise Analysis

*All prices: age 35, WW excl. USA, ~$1,000 deductible.*

---

## Step 1 — Optimum Global tier ladder: what each upgrade buys relevant to your concerns

Your concerns in order: (1) full outpatient for cancer, (2) full outpatient for catastrophic non-cancer chronic illness, (3) no cap that could bankrupt you.

| Tier | Monthly | Annual max | Cancer (in+out) | General outpatient | Chronic meds outpatient | Diagnostics outpatient | USA emergency | Verdict for your needs |
|------|---------|------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Emerald** | ~$154 | $1,000,000 | **In Full** | $500 total | Inside the $500 cap | $1,000 sub-limit | None | ❌ $500 outpatient covers maybe two specialist visits. |
| **Sapphire** | ~$170 | $2,000,000 | **In Full** | **Zero** (no outpatient) | Zero | $1,000 standalone | $50,000 | ❌ No outpatient at all except diagnostics. Worse than Emerald. |
| **Ruby** | ~$264 | $3,000,000 | **In Full** | $3,500 total (all outpatient combined) | Inside the $3,500 cap | Inside the $3,500 cap | $75,000 | ⚠️ Cancer = fine. But $3,500 for everything else: one course of RA or Crohn's biologics ($15k–$50k/yr outpatient) destroys this. |
| **Jade** | ~$331 | $5,000,000 | **In Full** | $10,000 total | Inside the $10,000 cap | **In Full (separate, unlimited)** | $100,000 | ⚠️ Diagnostics unlimited is good. $10,000 for drugs + visits still runs out with expensive biologics. |
| **Diamond** | ~$363 | $8,000,000 | **In Full** | **In Full** (no cap) | **In Full** (no cap) | **In Full** | **In Full** (45 days/trip) | ✅ Only tier with genuine protection against catastrophic outpatient beyond cancer. |

### What Diamond buys over Jade (~$32/month, ~$384/year)

- **Outpatient $10,000 cap → unlimited.** If you develop RA, Crohn's, MS, or autoimmune disease, biologics alone can be $15k–$80k/year outpatient. Jade cuts you off at $10k.
- **USA emergency**: $100,000 → In Full. A US hospital admission for serious illness easily exceeds $100k.
- **Home nursing**: $10,000 → $15,000/26 weeks.

**Conclusion:** Jade is the only sub-Diamond tier worth considering at all, and only if you're confident you won't develop an expensive non-cancer chronic condition. Diamond is the only tier that truly solves the catastrophic outpatient problem.

---

## Step 2 — Optimum Global Diamond (~$363/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) or Best (€245/mo)

Diamond costs roughly double Barmenia Plus.

### What Diamond has that Barmenia does not

| Advantage | Diamond | Barmenia | Impact |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Oncology specialty drug certainty** | Confirmed In Full in TOB, zero ambiguity | ⚠️ Q15 open — must get written confirmation | If Q15 = "yes", this gap closes entirely. If "no", Diamond is worth every cent more for cancer. |
| **Emergency hospital payment guarantee** | AXA issues direct payment guarantee — you never front the bill | Reimbursement process ⚠️ | In a LatAm emergency, not needing to front €50k+ is material. |
| **USA emergency** | In Full, trips up to 45 days | Emergency only, 6 weeks, no planned treatment | If you need a US specialist or get seriously ill there: Diamond covers fully, Barmenia covers only the acute emergency. |
| **AXA emergency network** | AXA coordinates globally, 24/7 | DR-WALTER (strong German bureaucracy, less hands-on emergency response) | In a medical crisis abroad, AXA's operational network matters. |

### What Barmenia has that Diamond does not

| Advantage | Barmenia Plus (€185) | Barmenia Best (€245) | Diamond |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Annual policy maximum** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** | $8,000,000 |
| **Price** | **€185/mo** | **€245/mo** | ~$363/mo (~$175 more than Plus) |
| **Regulatory strength** | **German law, BaFin, PKV Ombudsman** | Same | UK/Labuan FSA |
| **Air Doctor direct billing** | 20,000+ outpatient clinics, no fronting money | Same | Pay-and-claim only |

### The $175/month question

Over 10 years that is ~$21,000 extra for Diamond. **The only two things that justify it:**
1. **Q15 is "no"** — Barmenia doesn't cover oncology biologics/immunotherapy. Then Diamond is worth every cent.
2. **You frequently need full USA coverage** — for planned specialist treatment or trips longer than 6 weeks.

**Verdict:** Resolve Q15 in writing first. If Barmenia confirms specialty oncology drugs are covered at 100%, Barmenia Plus gives equivalent cancer protection and a better policy max at half the price.

---

## Step 3 — Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) vs Barmenia Best (€245/mo): what €60/month buys

Cancer and serious illness coverage is **identical** between Plus and Best.

| Feature | Plus | Best |
|---------|------|------|
| Preventive care / checkups | None | **100%** |
| Vaccinations | None | **100%** |
| Dental cleaning | None | **2× per year** |
| Dental prostheses | None | **50%** |
| Vision aids | None | Up to €300/2 years |
| Outpatient psychotherapy | 3 sessions only | **Full** (after 10 months) |
| Outpatient rehabilitation | None | **Full** |
| Extended prenatal | None | First-trimester screening, amniocentesis |

For your concerns (cancer, catastrophic illness), Plus is sufficient. Best adds comfort and preventive benefits, nothing relevant to catastrophic coverage.

---

## Step 4 — SafetyWing ($161/mo) vs the others

SafetyWing is the cheapest plan. Key facts for your concerns:

| Scenario | SafetyWing coverage |
|----------|---------------------|
| Cancer (chemo, radiation, drugs) | ✅ **100% UCR, explicitly outside $5k outpatient cap** |
| Dialysis | ✅ 100% UCR inpatient or outpatient, outside $5k cap |
| General outpatient (GP, chronic meds, specialist visits) | ❌ $5,000/year hard cap |
| Expensive non-cancer biologics (RA, Crohn's, MS) | ❌ Within $5k cap — runs out fast |
| Annual policy max | ⚠️ $1,500,000 (vs unlimited for Barmenia/Genki Premium) |
| Age limit | ⚠️ Must apply before age 64 |

**SafetyWing verdict for your concerns:** Good enough if your only catastrophic worry is cancer. Inadequate if you're also worried about expensive non-cancer chronic illness. Saves ~$200/month vs Diamond.

---

## Step 5 — Barmenia (€185–245/mo) vs Genki Native

*Note: Genki Native price not yet quoted.*

### What Genki Premium has that Barmenia does not

| Advantage | Genki Premium | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Israel home country** | **Unlimited — Full Country Coverage** | Barmenia limits you to 180 days/year; Genki Premium has zero restriction |
| **Direct hospital payment** | MCI Assist pays hospital directly | Same advantage as AXA for Diamond |
| **No age limit** | Explicitly none | Barmenia also has no stated limit, but Genki is explicit |
| **Specialty drug generic rule** | If no generic exists → brand-name covered in full | This is the common case for modern cancer drugs |

### What Barmenia has that Genki does not

| Advantage | Barmenia | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Specialty drug clarity** | If Q15 = yes: explicit 100%, no generic cap at all | Genki's generic rule is a theoretical risk for older drugs |
| **German regulation (BaFin)** | Strongest consumer protection in EU | Legal disputes favor you more clearly |
| **Air Doctor integration** | Direct billing at 20,000+ outpatient clinics | Practical for frequent outpatient use |

### The generic drug issue for cancer specifically

Genki covers medication "up to the price of a generic equivalent if a generic is available." For cancer: most modern targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and CAR-T drugs have **no generic** — they're patented brand-name only. In those cases the rule doesn't apply. For older chemotherapy drugs with generics, Genki covers only the generic cost. In practice, for serious modern cancer treatment, this rule is unlikely to hurt you, but it is a real clause that Diamond and (if Q15 = yes) Barmenia do not have.

---

## Decision Matrix

| Priority | Best plan | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Cancer + specialty drugs, zero ambiguity | **Optimum Global Diamond** | Confirmed In Full in TOB; explicit cancer in/outpatient line covers all drugs |
| Same protection, half the price | **Barmenia Plus** (if Q15 = yes) | €185/mo, No Limit, equivalent cancer coverage — requires Q15 written confirmation |
| Unlimited Israel stays | **Genki Premium** | Full Country Coverage; no day limit; but awaiting price quote |
| Cheapest cancer-specific coverage | **SafetyWing $161/mo** | Oncology explicitly carved out at 100% outside $5k cap — adequate for cancer, not for expensive non-cancer chronic illness |
| Full protection for both cancer AND expensive non-cancer chronic illness | **Barmenia Plus or Diamond** | Both have no outpatient cap for chronic conditions; SafetyWing and Genki Basic both have limits that expensive biologics can exceed |
