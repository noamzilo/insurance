# International Health Insurance Comparison

**Profile:** Noam Salomonski, age 35, male, no fixed residence, Latin America base, Israeli + German dual citizenship. No plans for children. Priority: full outpatient coverage for cancer and non-cancer catastrophic illness (expensive chronic conditions, biologics, serious illness). Deductible acceptable.

---

## Plans Under Consideration

SafetyWing is **eliminated**: the $5,000/year hard cap on general outpatient means a serious non-cancer chronic condition (RA, MS, Crohn's, autoimmune disease requiring biologics) is effectively uncovered. Cancer itself has a separate benefit line, but everything else outpatient is capped at $5,000 — which one month of biologics can exhaust.

**The three relevant plans:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual max | Outpatient |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Barmenia Plus** (NOMADS.insure) | ~$200 (€185) | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Genki Native Premium** | **$346** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** |
| **Optimum Global Diamond** (BrokerFish) | ~$363 | $8,000,000 | **In Full** |

Barmenia Best (€245/mo) adds nothing relevant for catastrophic illness — see end of document.
Genki Basic ($248/mo) has a €1,000,000 annual cap — inadequate if a serious illness runs multi-year.
Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers have outpatient caps that cannot handle expensive chronic illness — see end of document.

## Renewability & Age Limits

| | Barmenia Plus | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Renewability** | "This contract is not limited in time" — renews indefinitely | "Does not end with a certain age or after a certain period" — renews indefinitely | Not stated in TOB or emails ⚠️ |
| **Age limit** | None stated | None — explicitly documented | None stated ⚠️ |
| **What happens at age 65** | Nothing — policy continues | Nothing — policy explicitly continues regardless of age | Unknown ⚠️ |
| **Premium increases with age** | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice required | Yes — age brackets; 1-month advance notice; can cancel if increase is age-triggered | Yes — not documented how |

All three plans increase premiums as you age into the next bracket (35→44, 45→49, etc.). None of the documented plans cut you off at any age. For planning purposes at age 35, the renewability question is about the policy language, not about the age limit to *apply* — which is only relevant if you haven't yet signed up.

## 2. Outpatient — The Critical Section

| | Barmenia Plus | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Annual outpatient cap** | **No Limit** | **No Limit** | **In Full** (no cap, within $8M policy max) |
| **GP / specialist visits** | 100% | Covered | In Full |
| **Prescribed medications (general)** | 100% | Covered — generic equivalent rule applies¹ | In Full |
| **Lab / imaging (CT, MRI, PET)** | 100% | Covered | In Full |
| **Emergency room (outpatient)** | Covered | Covered | In Full |
| **Chronic condition meds (outpatient)** | 100%, no cap ⚠️ see Q15 below | Covered, no sub-cap — generic rule¹ | **In Full, confirmed, no ambiguity** |
| **Free choice of doctors** | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes (no referral needed) | Yes |

¹ *Generic equivalent rule (Genki):* Genki reimburses medication up to the cost of the cheapest available generic. If a generic exists for a drug, you cover the brand-name premium out of pocket. If no generic exists — which is the case for most modern targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and biologics — the rule does not apply and the full cost is covered.

## 10. Open Questions Before Signing

| Question | Barmenia Plus | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|

Potential out-of-pocket cost only for drugs where a generic exists. | ✅ Confirmed in full — explicit TOB line, no ambiguity. |
| **⚠️ Q17 — Germany as second home country** | Does German citizenship trigger a second 180-day limit, splitting the allowance? | ✅ Both Israel and Germany get unlimited Full Country Coverage. No issue. | ⚠️ Not addressed. |

# What Extra Money Buys

## SafetyWing ($161/mo) — Eliminated

SafetyWing covers cancer treatment at 100% under its own benefit line. However, all other outpatient costs — including specialist visits, medications, and chronic illness treatment — are subject to a $5,000/year hard cap. One month of biologics for RA, MS, or Crohn's can cost $3,000–$8,000. SafetyWing is eliminated because it cannot protect against catastrophic non-cancer outpatient costs.

---

## Barmenia Plus (~$200/mo) vs Genki Premium ($346/mo) — +$146/month

What the extra $146/month buys over Barmenia Plus:

| Benefit | Barmenia Plus | Genki Premium | Impact |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Israel home country** | 180 days/year limit | **Unlimited** | High if you plan extended Israel stays. Irrelevant if you stay under 6 months/year. |
| **Germany home country** | ⚠️ May also trigger 180-day limit | **Unlimited** | High if Q17 = "yes, Germany also counts." |
| **Direct hospital payment** | Not documented | **MCI Assist pays directly** | High in practice — you never need to front a large hospital bill in an emergency. |
| **Oncology drug certainty** | ⚠️ Q15 open | Generic rule (minor risk for modern cancer drugs) | If Q15 = "yes" for Barmenia, this advantage largely disappears. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | No Limit | Tied. |
| **Renewability certainty** | Explicitly indefinite | Explicitly indefinite | Tied. |
| **Single hospital room** | Standard | **Single room** | Comfort; not medically material. |

**Verdict on +$146/month:** Justified primarily if (a) you plan significant time in Israel, or (b) Q15 comes back negative for Barmenia (meaning Barmenia doesn't cover oncology biologics). Otherwise hard to justify.

---

## Genki Premium ($346/mo) vs Optimum Global Diamond ($363/mo) — +$17/month

Only $17/month difference. Diamond buys over Genki Premium:

| Benefit | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond | Impact |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Oncology specialty drugs** | Covered; generic rule applies (minimal risk for modern drugs) | **Confirmed in full, no generic rule, zero ambiguity** | If you want absolute certainty on cancer drug coverage, Diamond closes this entirely. |
| **USA coverage** | 28-day emergency only (life-threatening) | **In Full, up to 45 days, including planned treatment** | High if you plan to see US specialists or travel to the US for treatment. |
| **AXA emergency network** | MCI Assist (strong; direct hospital payment) | AXA (very large global network; direct hospital payment) | Marginal difference in practice for LatAm. |
| **Policy maximum** | No Limit | $8,000,000 | Genki Premium is strictly better here — No Limit vs $8M cap. |
| **Israel coverage** | Unlimited | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki Premium is strictly better. |
| **Regulatory** | Liechtenstein FMA | UK FCA / Labuan FSA | Both weaker than Barmenia's BaFin. |
| **Renewability** | Explicitly indefinite | Not documented ⚠️ | Genki is more certain. |

**Verdict on +$17/month:** For just $17/month more, Diamond buys complete oncology drug certainty (no generic rule) and full USA planned treatment coverage. Genki Premium wins on policy max and Israel coverage. At this price gap, Diamond makes sense if US access or drug certainty is important to you.

---

## Optimum Global sub-Diamond tiers — Eliminated

| Tier | Monthly | Problem |
|------|---------|---------|
| Emerald | ~$154 | $500 total outpatient budget. Worthless for serious chronic illness. |
| Sapphire | ~$170 | Zero outpatient (except diagnostics). Worse than Emerald for outpatient. |
| Ruby | ~$264 | $3,500 total outpatient. One month of expensive biologics wipes it out. |
| Jade | ~$331 | $10,000 total outpatient. Better, but one year of RA/MS biologics ($15k–$80k) still exceeds it. |

All four tiers are eliminated. Cancer is covered In Full on all Optimum Global tiers including Emerald. The problem is everything else outpatient — all non-cancer chronic illness, specialist visits, and medications are capped, and the caps are too low for serious illness.

---

## Barmenia Best (€245/mo) vs Barmenia Plus (€185/mo) — +€60/month

For your concerns (catastrophic illness, cancer): **identical**. Best adds no additional protection for serious illness whatsoever.

What the €60/month (€720/year) buys:
- Preventive checkups and vaccinations (cheap in LatAm; €100–300 value/year)
- 2× dental cleanings/year (€30–120 value depending on country)
- 50% dental prosthetics — meaningful if you need a crown or bridge (€300–750 saved per tooth)
- Full outpatient psychotherapy vs 3 sessions — meaningful if you need ongoing mental health support
- Outpatient rehabilitation — meaningful if you need physio after injury/surgery (could be €2,000–5,000 in a bad year)

**Verdict:** Start with Plus. The €720/year extra only pays off in specific events (dental reconstruction, injury rehab, ongoing therapy). If none of those apply in a given year, you've overpaid by €720 for benefits you could cover out of pocket cheaply in LatAm.

## Final Shortlist

| | Barmenia Plus | Genki Premium | Optimum Global Diamond |
|--|--|--|--|
| Monthly | ~$200 | $346 | ~$363 |
| Cancer treatment | ✅ (⚠️ Q15 for specialty drugs) | ✅ (generic rule; low risk) | ✅ confirmed |
| Non-cancer catastrophic outpatient | ✅ No Limit (⚠️ Q15) | ✅ No Limit | ✅ In Full |
| Policy maximum | No Limit | No Limit | $8M |
| Israel stays | 180 days/yr | **Unlimited** | ⚠️ unclear |
| Direct hospital payment | ⚠️ unclear | ✅ MCI Assist | ✅ AXA |
| Renewability certainty | ✅ explicit | ✅ explicit | ⚠️ not stated |
| Oncology drug certainty | ⚠️ Q15 open | Low risk (generic rule) | ✅ confirmed |
| Regulatory protection | **BaFin (best)** | Liechtenstein | UK/Labuan |

**The decision tree:**
1. Get Q15 answered by Christoph in writing.
   - If **yes** (Barmenia covers oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus at $200/mo is the clear value winner. Genki Premium ($346) is only better if you plan extended Israel stays. Diamond ($363) adds only USA planned treatment access for $163/mo more.
   - If **no** (Barmenia does not cover oncology biologics): Barmenia Plus is eliminated for cancer risk. Choose between Genki Premium ($346, generic rule caveat) and Diamond ($363, confirmed full coverage).
