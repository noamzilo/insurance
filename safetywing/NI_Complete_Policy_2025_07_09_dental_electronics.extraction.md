What is not
covered
(exclusions)?

<a id='440a11cd-e5fe-4191-8686-2be958bd75f7'></a>

This section is important to read, because assuming something is covered,
and then realizing after the incident that it is not, is a lot worse than assuming
something isn't covered and later realizing it is. If you read this section of
what is not covered, you have some idea of what to avoid so that you make
sure you take the right precautions and don't put yourself in situations where
insurance won't cover you. Everything listed below is relevant to all parts of
the coverage.

<a id='f26a86db-6895-4d1c-a049-854961688371'></a>

1. Failure to keep a scheduled appointment.
2. Payable under worker's compensation or employer's liability laws, or by any coverage provided or required by law.
3. Travel or accommodations, except as explicitly described in the covered sections.
4. Anything that happened outside of your active insurance period.
5. The incident relates to a crime you committed or are suspected of having committed.
6. The incident was caused by your negligence.
7. The incident happened within your primary residence, except as described under the section "An unforeseen event which you need to attend (trip interruption)".
8. Charges exceeding usual, reasonable and customary.
9. Claims made more than 60 days after the end date.
10. Anything that is not described in the covered sections of this Description of Cover.
11. We do not pay for claims if the expenses have been paid by other insurance or you have received a reimbursement from any other source.

<a id='acc17c95-5960-4df3-8a65-44b7c8fa945f'></a>

## How to file a claim

<a id='8d46e0c2-c389-4486-a5b7-41a41d99726d'></a>

You may submit your claim as follows:
1. Pay yourself and submit a claim for reimbursement on the SafetyWing website, or email claims@safetywing.com. Some claims require that you notify us beforehand, or that we arrange for the payment as described below.

**Important Notice and Disclaimer Concerning the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act**

This insurance is not subject to, and does not provide certain insurance benefits required by the United States' Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"). PPACA requires certain US citizens or US residents to obtain PPACA compliant health insurance, or "minimum essential coverage." PPACA also requires certain employers to offer PPACA compliant insurance coverage to their employees. Tax penalties may be imposed on U.S. residents or citizens who do not maintain minimum essential coverage, and on certain employers who do not offer PPACA compliant insurance coverage to their employees. In some cases, certain individuals may be deemed to have minimum essential coverage under PPACA even if their insurance coverage does not provide all of the benefits required by PPACA. You should consult your attorney or tax professional to determine whether this policy meets any obligations you may have under PPACA.

## Section 1. Agreement

VUMI® Group, I.I. (VUMI®), hereinafter the “Company” or the “Insurer,” issues a Policy in the name of the Policyholder listed on the Certificate of Coverage. The benefits detailed in this Policy related to the covered expenses incurred by him/her or his/her eligible Dependents under his/her certificate, as a result of any treatment, service or medical supply anywhere in the world where the plan offers coverage, after the Effective Date of this Policy, while it is in effect.

<a id='bc13bc6d-ede4-47b9-b31b-2d17d15a77df'></a>

All benefits are subject to the terms and general and particular conditions of this Policy, including the applicable co-pays, maximum benefits and the limits detailed in the Table of Benefits and the Certificate of Coverage which are an integral part thereof.

<a id='83508013-7bc7-415b-acd9-1f653a51e74a'></a>

## 1.1 Right to examine the Policy
The Policyholder understands that this Policy is an international health insurance plan that is not subject to regulations and/or mandatory coverage required by the laws of his/her Country of Residence or other, therefore, it may not comply with coverage, underwriting, and other insurance regulatory provisions of the Insured's Country of Residence. This insurance Policy is not subject to and does not provide certain benefits required by the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The Policyholder must review the terms of the coverage to verify he/she is in agreement with the coverage offered, and otherwise request the cancellation of this Policy and return it to the Company within a fifteen (15)-day period after receiving it. If during that period no claims have been made, the Company will reimburse the total premium paid and the Policy will be null and void, as if it was never issued.

<a id='f5f4b7a3-ca4c-4e0c-b489-e513185ad146'></a>

*Reimbursement of the unearned premium*
If the Policyholder cancels the Policy after the fifteen (15)-day reviewing period, or after being reinstated or renewed, the Company will reimburse the unearned portion of the premium up to a maximum of sixty-five percent (65%) of the total amount of the premium. The administrative fees and a thirty-five percent (35%) retention by the Company will not be reimbursed. In case of rescission of the Policy, the Company will apply the premium received to any payment made for a claim against the Policy.

<a id='e0b3e8b2-7113-4b38-9bb8-836d76ef9311'></a>

## 1.2 Important notice about the Application
This Policy is issued based on the statements provided in good faith by the Policyholder and the complete payment of the corresponding premium. The Company reserves the right to accept or reject any Application.

<a id='73ea805b-ebbf-45e8-98b8-f48dc29e0312'></a>

If any of the information disclosed in the Application
is false, incorrect, incomplete, had the intent of
misleading or deceiving, or was omitted, resulting
in worsening the risk, the Policy will be rescinded,
will have no effect, and the Company will not be
responsible for any payments of the benefits
offered under this Policy, releasing the Company
of any responsibility for the payment of benefits
stipulated hereunder, as the case may be.

<a id='ab16dfe1-97af-4272-9f68-2facf4d3b6aa'></a>

Likewise, it is understood that it will result in the
same aforementioned effect if a Provider or any
other individual or entity who has rendered medical
services to the Policyholder or any of the Insureds,
should submit false statements in collusion with the
Policyholder and/or any of the Insureds with the
purpose of claiming payments against this Policy,
its sections and/or Amendments, the Policy would
be at the discretion of the Company, rescinded or
cancelled, will have no effect and the Company will
not be responsible for any payments of the benefits
offered under this Policy.

<a id='6e75c881-c64a-4a0d-ba8f-cb4d816bdb86'></a>

a result of an omission, incorrect disclosure or
negligence by the Policyholder, any Insured, or due

## 4.7 Delivery of medical information to the registered Agent
The Policyholder, by accepting the coverage that this plan offers, expressly states that all Insureds in the Policy understand and accept that the registered Agent may access all confidential and private medical information (past, present and future) submitted to the Insurer, any of its affiliates or subcontractors, as well as the private medical information issued by the Insurer.

<a id='3f2b9a56-eecb-4ced-bc43-c62524cab4b3'></a>

The Policyholder, therefore, accepts that the
Insurer makes this information available to
the Agent in order to facilitate the transfer of
information on his/her behalf between the Insured
and the Insurer during the claims process and/
or provision of medical treatments that the
Policyholder and any other Dependents covered
under this Policy may receive. The Policyholder,
therefore, grants his/her consent to the Insurer,
Agent and/or administrator to access this
information, acknowledging that the Insurer has
no obligation to request his/her consent. On the
contrary, the Insured, knowingly and voluntarily,
requests granting such access to the information
for the Agent and/or administrator in any manner
that the Insurer chooses, at its sole discretion.

<a id='d1a49f6c-e1b0-47f3-9642-abba4fc5a2bd'></a>

## 4.8 Notification of legal separation or divorce

In case of legal separation or divorce, the Policyholder must notify the Company within thirty (30) days of the event. The Dependent Spouse or Domestic Partner will have coverage until the end of the Policy year and subsequently the Company will offer his/her own Policy of the same plan and conditions as the previous Policy. The premium of the new Policy must be paid within thirty (30) days of its Effective Date.

<a id='bd72cda4-143c-4dac-9e10-685893b75ca0'></a>

## 4.9 Medical notifications

<a id='dccd61ff-13cb-41ae-b370-1cb9b1fe6140'></a>

fail to notify the Company accordingly, they will be
responsible for thirty percent (30%) of all covered
costs. This penalty will only apply for claims above
US$500.

<a id='ee76b7df-5eb2-484a-bb61-e86157d1efe0'></a>

Additionally, in the event of fraud, the Policyholder will be immediately liable to the Insurer for all payments made improperly by the Company to the Insured or directly to the Provider of any benefits under this Policy. In these cases, there will be no right of reimbursement of the unearned premium of the Policy.

<a id='1164cabd-76c4-4825-a746-58745e44eccf'></a>

### 4.15. Change of plan

<a id='b5505304-3f7f-4eec-8388-c359cb7bbbcc'></a>

not be covered, and omission of declaration may
lead to the modification, rescission or cancelation

may modify, rescind, cancel, or not renew the
Policy due to the omission of a Pre-existing

The insured must complete an application and
submit up to date medical records within the

policy term. Submitting this medical application to

## 5.2 Grace Period
The Company grants a thirty (30)-day Grace Period to pay the annual renewal premium of the Policy, which begins the day after the Expiration Date of the Policy, according to the selected payment mode. If the premium is not paid within the Grace Period, the Insurer will terminate the Policy at 23:59 on the last day for which the premium had been paid. If the full premium is not received by the Company before the Grace Period ends, this Policy shall be deemed expired as of its Expiration Date. During the Grace Period, no benefits or payments will be provided for expenses incurred after the Expiration Date. If the premium is paid during this period, the Policy will be renewed.

<a id='0df0837e-8f95-428d-b041-4e33b1e61755'></a>

## 5.3 Premium payment
The on-time payment of the premium is the responsibility of the Policyholder. The premium is payable on the Renewal Date of the Policy. Payment of the premium keeps the Policy current for the time such payment corresponds. The premium paid in excess will not grant additional responsibility for such excess, but only and exclusively to the refund of such premium paid in excess, without interest. The difference will be refunded by the Insurer in the same form of payment in which it was received.

<a id='5382b72a-1d37-4fa9-854e-f0878f79ea0f'></a>

Failure to pay the premium within the agreed
period, or at the time when it becomes due, will
entitle the Insurer to unilaterally and fully void this
Policy as hereby established.

<a id='529425b1-c800-47ce-8d68-b194968cd916'></a>

## 5.4 Payment notices
The premium is payable on the Expiration Date of the Policy. Renewal notices are issued as a courtesy and the Company does not guarantee delivery. If the Policyholder does not receive a payment notice thirty (30) days before the Expiration Date, and the Policyholder does not know the premium amount, he/she must contact the Agent or the Insurer. The collection efforts of the premium made by the Insurer does not imply the resignation of the Company of its right to terminate this Policy for lack of payment.

<a id='b060de94-4d9c-4b6e-a008-7d28d6d65bb8'></a>

Failure to pay the renewal premium on or before
the Expiration Date will be interpreted as the
expressed will of the Policyholder to not renew this
Policy.

<a id='6db4c44c-b403-425c-8d8f-bcb9c312ace8'></a>

## 5.5 Rate changes
The Insurer reserves the right to change the premium rates on the date of each anniversary of this Policy, according to the inflation of medical costs.

<a id='4b9751f4-26ff-4f4a-82f6-579d9d02580b'></a>

## 9.1 Notifications and/or pre-authorizations

It is recommended that the Insured notifies the Company when receiving medical treatment, be it in the Hospital or as an outpatient. This will give the Company the opportunity to verify the terms and conditions in which the treatment will be covered, as well as improve and maximize the level of coverage available to the Insured, make suggestions about the best places for his/her care, provide logistical support and, whenever possible, make arrangements to establish direct payment to the Hospital or Doctor of choice, thereby reducing the possibility that the Insured will have to incur an unexpected or excessive out-of-pocket expense.

<a id='68e71041-8659-4273-b73b-794850c1f3be'></a>

In order to guarantee direct payment and the
coordination of benefits, notification is required.
Therefore, the Insured must notify the Company in

K. USA elective treatment.

The Insured must notify the Company at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to receiving those medical services that require notification or pre-authorization. The Company must also be given notice of all medical Emergencies that require notification within seventy-two (72) hours after the event that caused the Emergency. If the Policyholder and/or the Insureds fail to notify the Company accordingly, they shall then be responsible for thirty percent (30%) of all covered costs.

<a id='678540e6-c05f-4de2-b594-4c9f1339c0a2'></a>

All notices and other necessary communication
between the parties will be sent in writing by mail

## 9.2 Claims
The Company, in most cases, will make payments directly to physicians and Hospitals worldwide in legal currency for covered expenses, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Policy. When this is not possible, the Company will reimburse the covered costs to the Insured in accordance with the applicable Usual, Customary and Reasonable (UCR) fees or the contracted rates between the Company and the Provider.

<a id='214e93e9-9b59-45db-9788-225a2ff2f69c'></a>

In no case will the compensation amount exceed the amount billed. If the Insured receives compensation that exceeds the invoice amount by mistake, the Insured will be obligated to immediately return the excess amount to the Company, or the Company will deduct the outstanding balance from any other amount pending to settle with the Insured.

<a id='c0f9eeac-8fc5-4826-b83c-be7d17b82a7c'></a>

The Company shall receive all medical and non-medical information required. In order for the claims process to begin, the Company must receive the following information:

<a id='781bb230-18d1-4e1c-8b06-da1c09b1abfd'></a>

the Insured may have when submitting a
claim.

for reimbursement from different Insureds, the
expenses for each Insured, Accident, Illness and/
or Provider must be divided into single Insureds
and events. Once the claim process has been
initiated, the Insured must send all the information
requested by the Company to complete the
process in a period of no longer than ninety (90)
days from the first request by the Company. Once
this period has elapsed without receiving the
requested information, the claim will not proceed
and the Company will be relieved of any obligation.

<a id='41b81d12-ec91-4207-81bc-ec47b53f685b'></a>

turnaround time for reimbursement to the Insured
will be fifteen (15) business days.

<a id='eb75c1ac-4ebb-4552-a53d-718769743327'></a>

If the information provided should be considered inadequate or is incomplete, it may create a delay in the payment or reimbursement process, or it may cause the claim to be temporarily closed until the necessary information is received within the stipulated time limit. The Company reserves the right to request the original receipts, medical records and/or any other relevant documentation in order to process the claim. The Company will not return original documentation received to process a claim; however, it may offer a copy of such documentation when requested. In the event that a claim that should have been denied because coverage was excluded from the Policy has been paid in error, the Company will not be obligated to continue paying for the expenses of treatments or services related to such claim from the date of the identification of the error, and may request the reimbursement of the amounts unduly paid.

<a id='14b2a195-73a1-49df-8f99-ce118f0a1b11'></a>

The Company will not be responsible for any
fees charged by the receiving bank, such as
commissions for currency exchange or for
incoming wire transfers. These charges will be the
responsibility of the recipient of the payment.

## 9.5 Subrogation and indemnity
The Company has the right of subrogation or reimbursement of payments made if the Insured has recovered all or part of said payments from a third party.

<a id='49af78c7-bef6-417a-9fff-4c2efd5efcc0'></a>

The Company will subrogate up to the amount
paid, under all its rights and actions, against third
parties that, due to the damage suffered, the
Insured is entitled to. The Policyholder shall have
the obligation to cooperate with the Company to
recover from the damage caused by third parties
or to obtain reimbursement of the expenses
covered by it.

<a id='b9119acc-31f1-4087-a313-9d802912d162'></a>

Failure to comply with this obligation entitles the Company to consider cancelling this Policy. The required cooperation includes, but is not limited to providing all relevant documentation or testimonial evidence and undergoing medical examinations, if necessary. The Company may make any claim on his/her behalf, before or after having made payments for expenses covered under this Policy.

<a id='75cc8ef6-a8fe-48cd-8323-528da2094a16'></a>

The Policyholder must refrain from taking any
action, reconciling or accepting agreements that
may adversely affect the Company's subrogation
rights in accordance with the provisions of this
article. Any claim action initiated by the Insured
in relation to damages that were covered by
this Policy must be notified immediately to the
Company, in order to assert its subrogation rights
on any payment related to the expenses covered
by the incident that originates the claims.
